The name of the ellipsis button varies, based on the result of using it. 

![Screenshot of the square blue ellipsis icon.](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/e/media/ellipsis-button/447573893.png)

On the first mention, provide a graphic of the button or include (â€¦) after the button name. On subsequent mentions, use the graphic rather than the words. 

Don't capitalize *ellipsis* when used as a button name.
