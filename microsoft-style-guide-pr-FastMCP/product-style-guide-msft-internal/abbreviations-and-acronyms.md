# Abbreviations and acronyms

These guidelines cover the appropriate use of abbreviations and acronyms in Microsoft 365 content. 

**Note:** *Abbreviation* is a general term for the shortened form of a word or phrase. In these guidelines, we use the term *acronym* to mean a word that’s formed by combining the first letters of a name or phrase. It can be pronounced like a word, such as *RAM,* or one letter at a time, like *USB.* 

Specific abbreviations and acronyms are covered in the [A–Z names and terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide. If you don’t find what you need in this style guide, check the [A–Z word list](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/a-z-word-list-term-collections/) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide* and [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

Remember that an abbreviated form might not exist in other languages. So even if you’re saving space in English, it might not result in space saving in a target language.

## Abbreviations of product and feature names

We rarely abbreviate names in public communications. For example, don’t use *PPT* for PowerPoint or *M365* for Microsoft 365. 

**Do**  
Microsoft 365 is designed to help people of all abilities be more productive and inclusive.

**Don’t**  
M365 is designed to help people of all abilities be more productive and inclusive.  
Microsoft 365 (M365) is designed to help people of all abilities be more productive and inclusive.

An exception is *AI* for *artificial intelligence*. For more information about AI, see [AI and bot terms](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/ai-bot-terms) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

## Acronyms

In general, use only acronyms that your audience is familiar with. If they’ll be confused by an acronym or won’t recognize it, introduce the acronym by spelling it out on the first mention in regular text, with the acronym in parentheses. On subsequent mentions in the same experience (such as screen, pane, article, or wizard), you can use the acronym without spelling it out.

The spelled-out form of an acronym is lowercase unless it’s a proper noun.

**Do**  
How to delete an IM or chat in Skype  
Customize instant messaging (IM) features based on your friends, family, and work contacts. [Note that *instant messaging* is lowercase.]  
Subscribe to an RSS feed from your web browser  
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) provides a quick way to read the latest updates from your favorite websites. Many websites offer RSS feeds.

**Don’t**  
Customize Instant Messaging (IM) features based on your friends, family, and work contacts. [Note that *Instant Messaging,* capitalized, is incorrect.]

Some acronyms are really well known and don’t need to be spelled out. If you're sure your audience is familiar with an acronym, it's OK to use it without spelling it out.

**Do**  
Skype requires a USB 2.0 video camera in order to utilize its video-calling features.

**Don’t**  
Skype requires a Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 video camera in order to utilize its video-calling features.

Don't spell out the term if the [A–Z names and terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide or the Microsoft Writing Style Guide says to use the acronym without spelling it out. 

Also, if you don’t need to use the acronym, consider using different, less technical-sounding wording.

**Do**  
Your network administrator has made it possible for you to sign in once to access all your Microsoft 365 apps—you don't need to enter your password over and over again.

**Don’t**  
Your network administrator has set up single sign-on (SSO)—you don't need to enter your password over and over again to access all your Microsoft 365 apps.
