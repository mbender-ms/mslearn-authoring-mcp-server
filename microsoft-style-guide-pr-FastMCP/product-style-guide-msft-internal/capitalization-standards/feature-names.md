# Feature names

Lowercase features unless otherwise indicated in the list of [A–Z names + terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide. (Generally, if it’s not a brand, product, service, app, or API, names are lowercase.)

**Lowercasing product features, capabilities, components, and general terms is our brand standard:**

- **Aligns with our go-to-market strategy.** Microsoft competes on a brand level as a vendor of solutions, and so we don't brand or capitalize the features and capabilities of individual products to compete and win.
- **Creates better user experiences.** Users are focused on getting tasks done, and looking for the option or command that aligns to their intent. UI labels that reflect the users' intent generally perform far better than feature names in testing.
- **Localization relies on capitalization to translate correctly.** Title cased names are the signal to localization teams to *not* translate a term because it’s a product name (or trademark). Meaning any title-cased term remains in English, styled as the name of a separate product. If it's really a feature, this can cause users to struggle, decreasing usability and satisfaction.
- **Reflects the realities of product roadmaps.** Cloud + AI products will continue to expand and come together in new ways. Capping an individual product's features deviates from our brand naming patterns which makes for less clear, cluttered, and inconsistent UI. And that in turn blocks us from delivering a unified and consistent cross-product user experience at scale without expensive rework. 
  
**Note:** A handful of older, legacy feature names couldn't be retrofit to lowercase and are captured as exceptions in [A–Z names + terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md).
