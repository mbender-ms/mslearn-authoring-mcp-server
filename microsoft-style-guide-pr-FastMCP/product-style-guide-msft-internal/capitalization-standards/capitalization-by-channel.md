# Capitalization by channel

Follow these guidelines for capitalizing common types of Cloud + AI content.

| Channel | Guideline |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation, instructions, and similar content | When procedures and instructions refer to UI elements and labels, follow the capitalization shown in the UI (regardless of whether or not it's correct). |
| Titles of blog posts and articles | Use sentence-style capitalization. Itâ€™s OK, though, to use title-style capitalization for blog posts and articles referenced in tweets if necessary for clarity. |
