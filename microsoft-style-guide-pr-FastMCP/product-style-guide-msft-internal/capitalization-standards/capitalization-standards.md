# Capitalization standards

The overuse of capitalization is the number one style mistake in Microsoft content. It can seem like capitalizing a term is a good way to emphasize it, but we need to be intentional about how and what we capitalize. 

- **Capital letters are like “speed bumps.”** Used sparingly and intentionally, they can focus the customer’s attention on the things we want their attention to be drawn to. But excessive capitalization is counterproductive. It lessens the impact of capitalization overall, and the customer just zones us out.

- **Microsoft has 1,000+ offerings.** We capitalize the names of brands, products, services, and apps—because those are the names we want to stand out, to help customers remember, recognize, find, and buy our offerings. If it’s not a brand, product, service, or app it’s lowercase. (Meaning in product, the names and labels for product features, capabilities, and UI components are lowercase.)

- **Capitalization is not messaging.** The best way to get your message across is to craft effective, readable, persuasive text that shows Microsoft understands the customer’s needs and focuses on the benefit to them. 

## Sentence-style capitalization is the default

Microsoft’s default approach to capitalization calls for sentence-style capitalization. 

Here's how to achieve sentence-style capitalization: 

- Capitalize the first word of titles, headings, subheadings, UI labels, and similar text strings. 

- Capitalize brand, product, service, and app names, plus any trademarks.

- Capitalize any names that are recognized as proper nouns outside of technical content—specifically, the names of people, places, and months, and days of the week.

- Use lowercase for everything else, including the names of features and capabilities.

## Other types of capitalization, for limited use

Although sentence-style capitalization is used most often in Cloud +AI content, some other capitalization styles are used sometimes, in certain circumstances. 

- In *title-style capitalization,* you capitalize the first letter of every word except for articles, short prepositions, and conjunctions. It’s called *title-style capitalization* because it’s used in job titles, like Vice President, and the titles of works, like books. 

- In *all caps* (also called *uppercase*), you capitalize all letters in a text string. All caps are used most often in the table headers in UI. 

## Tips for capitalization in Cloud + AI content

These guidelines will help you use capitalization correctly in Cloud + AI content and product UI: 

- Capitalize the first word of sentences. Rewrite sentences that start with a case-sensitive, lowercase word.

- Don’t use “camel case”—that is, when a word has a capital letter in the middle. This is also sometimes called *midcaps* or *intercaps.* 
  - Camel case can look very dated and technical, and not aligned with our brand voice. 
  - There are some exceptions, for example for technologies that Microsoft has acquired, such as PlayFab, or legacy names, such as DirectQuery. 
  - Consult the [A–Z list in this style guide](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md), the [A–Z list](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/a-z-word-list-term-collections/) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*, and *[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)*. Unless the term appears there in camel case, use lowercase.

- Don't use all caps or all lowercase for emphasis.

- Don't use all lowercase as a design choice.

- Lowercase the spelled-out form of an acronym except for any portion that's a proper noun. [Learn more about using acronyms](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md)
