# Checklist: How to write great UI text

Writing is a design skill. We use design to figure out all sorts of things: what a product does, how it works, and what it says. And, to our customer, well-designed UI feels like a conversation.  

**Top tips**

- Work to understand your customers, then tailor the experience to their needs.  
- Ban lorem ipsum. Always design with real, plausible text.
- Design around the customer’s primary intent—what they’re trying to accomplish.
- Always consider the context and the customer’s frame of mind during a specific interaction.
- Befriend your usability researcher and use their insights.
- Put the most important information, action, or issue in the most noticeable spot. 
- Aim for simple, straightforward, and human UI text—no technical jargon or acronyms.
- Write in Microsoft’s informal, conversational voice. (Remember short everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization.) 
- Read UI aloud. Can you read it in a robot voice? Keep iterating until it sounds human.
- Think about your customers and what those buttons and words mean to them. 
- Make it clear what will happen when you choose each option or select a link. 
- Use the same terms consistently for fundamental commands, menu items, and labels.
- Don’t get in the way. Great content is invisible. Prune every excess word.
- When something works, consider it a pattern that you can reuse.
- Keep a style sheet and contribute to your team’s guidance.
