# Designing product content

UX content design is a fundamental part of Microsoft Cloud + AI’s product design teams. We’re focused on using language as a design material to solve problems for the people and businesses using our products.

## Simple, straightforward, human

In products, we don’t need more content. We need content that does more. Content that’s simple, straightforward, and human. Quick tips for crafting content in tight spaces:  

1. **Get to the point fast.** Start with the key takeaway. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word.
2. **Talk like a person.** Write in Microsoft’s informal, conversational voice—like you’re (a human) talking one-on-one.
3. **Keep it simple.** Use simply structured plain language. Break it up. Step it out. Layer. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan or read. 

## Put the customer at the center 

CEO Satya Nadella has said “Obsessing over our customers is everybody’s job.” To design better product experiences, try going native—live our brand as our customers do. Use our products on every platform and device. Be curious and observant. Befriend your usability researchers. Leverage the resulting insights to help your team identify and solve for customers’ real needs and challenges.  

When shaping UI text, try asking yourself these questions:  

- **Who is the customer?** For example, will everyone see this screen, or is it for advanced customers only?  
- **What’s the customer trying to do?** (Not what do we want them to do.) Is this part of a larger task or customer goal? Is this a warning, error, or notification? 
- **What’s the customer’s frame of mind?** Is she anxious something’s gone wrong? Mad she can’t sign in? Confused about which option is best? Happy to have completed her task? Adjust your tone accordingly. 

## Designing content  

Good content meets customer needs. Great content exceeds them. Part of voice is modulating tone and attitude to map to the user’s intent in that moment of UI—from friendly and cheerful on the dashboard to scannable and just-the-facts (though natural and personable) for navigation menus, tiles, and panes. The words you choose should be easy to understand, have the right amount of information, and guide the customer to the right action for them.

One way to approach it:  

1. **Kick off the work to be done.** Your team likely has its own process for briefing teams on work items and working together to concept flows. Get involved as far upstream as you can. Be an advocate for the customer and meeting their real needs. 
2. **Start with the why, continue with the how, then do the what.** For now, ignore the words and focus on solving for the end-to-end flow. Ask PMs for missing details about the scenario—do you understand what's happening well enough to explain it? Use the “big six” questions that journalists rely on: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Step out the ideal flow in sketches or mockups with your design partner and PM, then discuss alternatives. 
3. **Temporarily set aside voice and style guidelines.** You'll apply them later, but applying them too early may constrain creativity. With the mockup in hand, write preliminary content for each screen element. Always write preliminary content—or at least rough in the “what to say” basics as your placeholder text. Using “lorem ipsum” conceals usability and design issues until late in the process. 
4. **Give enough info—but not too much.** First, try explaining the scenario as if talking to a friend who’s not particularly technical. Then, compare that to your content by reading it aloud—does it capture what you wanted to communicate clearly? What can be combined for brevity, or separated to make it simpler? What detail can be cut altogether—what’s not absolutely essential? 
5. **Put yourself in the customer’s shoes.** What do they need to know? How can you explain it succinctly and clearly? If it’s not clear how to do something, fix it by adding clarity in the interface writing and think about showing examples. If something is too cumbersome to do, fix it by better understanding the key tasks, breaking apart big decisions, prioritizing features, and simplifying interactions. If it still doesn’t seem like the flow will be easy and intuitive for customers, consider bringing it to a peer review for a fresh perspective.  
6. **Use Microsoft’s voice and tone.** Iterate on the preliminary content until the voice is conversational, clear, and concise. (For direction, see the [*Microsoft Our Voice* book](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Guidelines/Microsoft_ourVoice_guidelines.pdf).) At each point throughout the flow, make sure you’ve mapped the tone to the customer's likely frame of mind. 
7. **Collaborate.** Walk through your content with design and PM partners as well as in wall/peer reviews to identify potential issues. Use their feedback and insights from usability research to iterate rapidly. 
8. **Apply the rules.** When you're satisfied the content is complete, proof it against the guidance of this Microsoft Style Guide, Microsoft One Voice, and your product team style guide to make it customer-ready and consistent with our other brand experiences. “Minimum viable content” delivers value, ease of use, and conveys craftsmanship. Get granular about things like sticking with sentence-style capping and omitting end punctuation.
