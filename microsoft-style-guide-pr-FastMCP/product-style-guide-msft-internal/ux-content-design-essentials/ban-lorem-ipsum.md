# Ban lorem ipsum

We avoid lorem ipsum. Any placeholder text that’s essentially gibberish signals that a design hasn’t been thought through fully. Things like:  

- How will you truly know how much space text will take if you haven’t come up with real, plausible text?
- How will you be able to evaluate the balance, layout, spacing, and flow if you don’t know how much text will be displayed in real-life user scenarios?
- What about usability?
- How will you determine if your design is cluttered, or completely void of information?

The problem with lorem ipsum or other placeholder text is that we all tend to pick just the right amount of imaginary text to make the visual design look good. Once the real content strategy, structure, and text are developed, the flow is likely to fall apart.  

Instead, codesign solutions with your content-focused teammate. They bring the specialized skills to map out the flow, structure the information, and mock up preliminary content targeted to our user and their intent that's also aligned to our design system and brand vocabulary.
