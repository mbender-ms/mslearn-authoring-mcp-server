# Button order

Microsoft experiences on any platform place the primary call to action on the left side in a series of buttons.   

This example uses two buttons, "Discard" and "Cancel," in a dialog that confirms that someone wants to leave without saving their work. The primary call to action ("Discard") is on the left side. This way, the left-to-right reading order matches the logical order—what someone would most often select.

Placing the most-used option first also optimizes usability when tabbing from one item to the next. Assuming people will select "Discard" much more frequently than "Cancel" (in this example), those using a keyboard to tab to the buttons get to their preferred choice with one less keystroke.
