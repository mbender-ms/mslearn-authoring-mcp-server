# Formatting text in the UI

When instructions for users appear within the UI, it’s important to clearly set off the UI label from the surrounding text so that customers understand the actions they need to take. We use bold formatting to do this in Cloud + AI product UI.

To learn how to format UI elements that appear in instructions outside the UI—such as documentation and other technical content—see [Formatting text in instructions](/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide.*

**Guidelines**

- Use bold formatting when instructions appear in these places in product UI:  
  - Error messages  
  - Info balloons  
  - Notifications  
  - Terms of use  

- Use bold formatting to refer to the labels of these UI elements:  
  - Buttons  
  - Check boxes and other options  
  - Commands  
  - Dialog boxes  
  - Info balloons  
  - Menus  
  - Panes  
  - Tabs  

- Don’t use quotation marks (either “double” or ‘single’) or italic formatting to set off the UI label.  

- Use bold formatting just for the name of the UI element, not for the words *button, check box, command,* *pane*, and so on.

- Use bold formatting only in instructions to users—don’t make the actual UI label bold.

- If the action the user needs to take is already formatted as a link, don’t use bold.
