**Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice**

**Use bigger ideas, fewer words**
Our modern design hinges on crisp minimalism. Shorter is always better. To learn more, see [Brand voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human).

**Write like you speak**
Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words. To learn more, see [Brand voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human).

**Project friendliness**
Use contractions: *it’s, you’ll, you’re, we’re, let’s.* To learn more, see [Use contractions](/style-guide/word-choice/use-contractions).

**Get to the point fast**
Lead with what’s most important. Front-load keywords for scanning. Make customer choices and next steps obvious. To learn more, see [Scannable content](/style-guide/scannable-content/).

**Be brief**
Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word. To learn more, see [Word choice](/style-guide/word-choice/).

**When in doubt, don’t capitalize**
Default to sentence-style capitalization—capitalize only the first word of a heading or phrase and any proper nouns or names. Never Use Title Capitalization (Like This). Never Ever. To learn more, see [Capitalization](/style-guide/capitalization).

**Skip periods (and : ! ?)**
Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and items in a list that are three or fewer words. Save the periods for paragraphs and body copy. To learn more, see [Punctuation](/style-guide/punctuation), [Headings](/style-guide/scannable-content/headings), and [Lists](/style-guide/scannable-content/lists).

**Remember the last comma**
In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction: *Android, iOS, and Windows.* (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma.) To learn more, see [Commas](/style-guide/punctuation/commas).

**Don’t be spacey**
Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons—and no spaces around dashes. To learn more, see [Punctuation](/style-guide/punctuation).

**Revise weak writing** 
Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Edit out *you can*, *there is, there are,* and *there were*. To learn more, see [Verbs](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/security-terms) and [Word choice](/style-guide/word-choice/).
