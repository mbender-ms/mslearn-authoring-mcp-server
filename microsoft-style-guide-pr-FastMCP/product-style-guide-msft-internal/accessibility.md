# Accessibility

Ensuring accessibility in our products and communications makes a substantial difference in the lives of our customers. Taking the time to understand and create accessible content will help us empower all people to achieve even more.

For more comprehensive information about complying with Microsoft accessibility policies, see [Accessibility guidelines and requirements](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*.

If youâ€™re writing instructions for how to use Microsoft 365 products, be sure to follow the guidelines in [Procedures and instructions](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/procedures-instructions) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*. The [Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/accessibility/SitePages/Microsoft-Accessibility-Standards-(MAS).aspx) requires us to support customers of all abilities by documenting all the ways that customers can interact with our UI, including mouse, keyboard, voice recognition, gesture, and so on (The Microsoft Accessibility Standards site requires Microsoft network access).
