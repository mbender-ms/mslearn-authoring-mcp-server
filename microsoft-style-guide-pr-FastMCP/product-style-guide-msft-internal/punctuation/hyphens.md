# Hyphens

The hyphen (-) is different from the em dash (—) and the en dash (–), and they do different things. Don’t use hyphens, em dashes, and en dashes interchangeably.

In general, hyphens combine words (as in *on-premises*), whereas em dashes signal a break in thought or set off parenthetical text. Example: The on-premises data gateway provides secure data transfer between on-premises data—which is data that isn't in the cloud—and several Microsoft cloud services.

## Compound modifiers

A compound modifier is two or more words that are joined to modify another word, most often a noun.

A good rule of thumb is that if the compound modifier precedes a noun, it’s hyphenated. If the modifier follows the noun, it’s spelled as two words without a hyphen. Examples:

third-party services  
services available from a third party  
real-time reporting  
Communicate in real time  
a well-architected framework  
The framework is well architected

However, don’t hyphenate:

- When the word very precedes another modifier. Example:  
  Very fast test

- When an adverb ending in *-ly* precedes another modifier. Examples:  
  extremely high paging rates  
  frequently accessed data

## Suspended compound modifiers

Sometimes part of a compound modifier is repeated. In this case, spell out the entire phrase unless space is very limited—don’t use a suspended compound modifier, where the repeated part is omitted.

machine-teaching and machine-learning models  
a one-year or three-year Azure reservation

**Not our style**  
machine-teaching and -learning models  
a one- or three-year Azure reservation

Don’t form suspended compound modifiers from one-word adjectives.

**Not our style**  
multi- and dual-factor authentication

## Prefixes  

Most words with common prefixes (such as *co-*, *non-*, *pre-*, *re-*, *multi-*, or *un-*) don’t include a hyphen. 

**Our style**  
coadmin  
multicloud  
multiprocessing  
multitenant  
reconfigured
