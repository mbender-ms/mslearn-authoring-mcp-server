# Colons + semicolons

Avoid cluttering heads and subheads with unnecessary colons (:) and only use the semicolon (;) when there's no alternative. Try an em dash instead.

A colon between two statements usually signifies that what follows the colon clarifies the phrase preceding the colon. A semicolon joins two clauses that are closely connected in meaning. However, sentences using colons and semicolons can be difficult to grasp, especially online. Try to use two sentences or other punctuation instead.

It’s OK to use colons to introduce a quotation and to set off a list within a sentence.
