# Periods

Don’t use ending punctuation in headlines, headings, subheadings, UI headers, UI labels, or simple lists (three or fewer words per item).

End all sentences, including hint (placeholder) text in a text box, with a period, even if they're only two words.

Follow a period with one space, not two.

Headline example:  Be brief—make every word count

Text example:  Be brief. Make every word count.

When a colon introduces a bulleted list:

- If one or more list elements completes the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every element.
- If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don’t end the elements with periods, even if they form a complete sentence together with the list introduction.
- If one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element.

Don't use periods between AM or PM.
