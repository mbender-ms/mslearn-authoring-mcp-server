# Dashes

## Em dash (—)

Em dashes—the long dashes that you see here—are different from hyphens, and em dashes and hyphens do different things.

Whereas hyphens combine words (as in *on-premises*), em dashes signal a break in thought or to set off parenthetical text. Don’t use hyphens, multiple hyphens, or short (en) dashes for this purpose—use proper em dashes.

- Never put spaces around em dashes.
- Don’t capitalize the word after an em dash unless it’s a proper noun.

**Our style**  
IT is on the move—to the cloud.  
On-premises, across multiple clouds, and at the edge—Azure meets you where you are.

**Not our style**  
IT is on the move--to the cloud.  
IT is on the move — to the cloud.  
IT is on the move—To the cloud.

Don’t overuse em dashes—too many can make your writing disjointed and irritating to read. But don’t be afraid to use them, either. In particular, em dashes are preferred to colons and semicolons.

## En dash (–)

En dashes are shorter than em dashes but longer than hyphens. En dashes, em dashes, and hyphens are different punctuation marks and they’re used for different things—it’s grammatically incorrect to use them interchangeably.

En dashes aren’t as common as hyphens or em dashes. But they’re used in a few important ways in Cloud + AI content, most notably to indicate a range of numbers, such as in time and date stamps in the UI.

**Examples**  
10:00 AM–2:00 PM [*in a program schedule*]  
2:15 AM 12/1/17 – 4:45 PM 4/1/17 [*in the UI*]

For more information, see [Time and date ranges](~\grammar-usage\time-day-date\time-and-date-ranges.md).

An en dash is also used sometimes instead of a hyphen in compound modifiers, when one part of the phrase is an open compound.

**Example**  
Azure-supported features [*note the use of a hyphen*]  
AI Builder–supported features [*note the use of an en dash*]
