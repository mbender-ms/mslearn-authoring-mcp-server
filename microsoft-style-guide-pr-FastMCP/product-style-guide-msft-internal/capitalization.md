# Capitalization

The default capitalization style in Microsoft 365 content is sentence-style capitalization. Basically, that means that all words in a line of text are lowercase except for the first word and any proper nouns—like in a sentence. We use sentence-style capitalization in most situations, including titles, headlines, and headings.

**Exceptions to sentence-style capitalization**

There are some exceptions, when title-style capitalization—that is, capitalizing most words—is used instead. 

Places where title-style capitalization is used include:

- UI labels in traditional Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook) 
- The names of blogs
- Book, e-book, and song titles
- White paper titles
- Titles of people (such as (Vice President or Director of Marketing) 

On the rare occasions when you need to use title-style capitalization, follow the [Capitalization](/style-guide/capitalization) guidelines in the _[Microsoft Writing Style Guide](Naming deck template)_.

**The following are always capitalized:**

- Product and app names (such as Microsoft 365, Microsoft Whiteboard, Microsoft Power Apps)
- Events (such as Inspire, Ignite, Ready)
- SKU names as part of a product name (such as Microsoft 365 Family, Microsoft 365 Business Basic)
- Bot names (such as Summarize)
- Marketing programs (such as New Culture of Work)
- Trademarks (to determine whether a name is a Microsoft trademark, see the [Trademark list and attribution requirements](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-trademark-list.aspx) on CELAWeb)
