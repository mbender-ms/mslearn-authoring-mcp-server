# Observations, assessments, forecasting

### Differentiating between observations, assessments, and forecasts

It is critical when producing intelligence to clearly differentiate what we know, what we assess, and what we predict.

- **Observations -** Observations are factual statements about what has occurred and can be objectively shown in data. Authors should be clear about what has factually occurred, and such assertions do not require estimative probability or confidence.
- **Assessments and analysis -** During the intelligence lifecycle, particularly during analysis phase, analysts review observations and make judgements based upon all available sources, context, and expertise. These judgements add more impact and value for consumers. Since assessments are not objectively proven, analysts should provide a level of confidence for their assessment.
- **Forecasting -** Consumers look to intelligence analysts to provide forecasts and recommendations based upon the intelligence being provided. Forecasts are forward-looking statements that assert what might occur to justify recommendations for consumers.

In some cases, teams will report on open-source intelligence (OSINT) that has no unique first-party input. In these cases, the writing should make clear that the reporting is sourced externally and has not been technically validated.
