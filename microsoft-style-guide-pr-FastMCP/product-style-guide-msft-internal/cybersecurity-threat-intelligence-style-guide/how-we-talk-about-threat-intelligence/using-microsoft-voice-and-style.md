# Using Microsoft voice and style

Our cybersecurity and threat intelligence content should be conveyed in the [Microsoft brand voice](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BingAdsMarketing/Field%20Marketing%20Document%20Center/Forms/AllItems.aspx?FolderCTID=0x012000945CCE7A11686F41986DD934A4F0DC75&id=/teams/BingAdsMarketing/Field%20Marketing%20Document%20Center/Field%20Enablement/VKB/VKB%20Team%20And%20Content%20Folder/Training/Editorial/Brand%20voice/MSFT_Our-Voice_Brand-Guidelines.pdf&parent=/teams/BingAdsMarketing/Field%20Marketing%20Document%20Center/Field%20Enablement/VKB/VKB%20Team%20And%20Content%20Folder/Training/Editorial/Brand%20voice). Although we address a distinctly technical audience about very technical concepts, we must speak with a voice that is:

- **Warm and relaxed, yet sophisticated.** We tell the story in a factual manner, more grounded in real conversations, approachable yet professional, not condescending nor self-deprecating. 
- **Appropriate tone for the seriousness of the situation being described.** This is especially when discussing wartime activity, victims of cybercrime, and other solemn topics.
- **Crisp and clear.** We get to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all.
- **Ready to lend a hand.** We show customers weâ€™re on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great and actionable information at just the right time.
- We have unified our threat intelligence initiatives and brand under one name, "Microsoft Threat Intelligence," reserving the team names such as Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) primarily for internal communications as well as specific customer communications.
- We refer to us as *Microsoft Threat Intelligence* or *we*, and them as *you* or *your team*.
