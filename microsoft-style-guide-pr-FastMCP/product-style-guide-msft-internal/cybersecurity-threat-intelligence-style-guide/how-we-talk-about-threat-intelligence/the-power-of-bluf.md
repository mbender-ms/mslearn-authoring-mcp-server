# The power of BLUF

We recommend the *bottom-line up front* (BLUF) communication technique that presents the main point or key findings at the beginning of a report, followed by supporting details and analysis. The intelligence community often uses this approach because stakeholders typically have limited time to read and absorb large amounts of information. It also has the benefit of allowing readers to know in advance how to contextualize subsequent information.

By presenting the most critical information up front, you can ensure that readers understand the key takeaways and can make quick decisions about how to respond to the threat. For example, when reporting on a new malware campaign, you might start by stating that the campaign is using a highly sophisticated and difficult-to-detect variant that has already infected several high-profile organizations in the industry. This bottom-line message conveys the urgency and severity of the threat, encouraging readers to take immediate action to protect their organization.
