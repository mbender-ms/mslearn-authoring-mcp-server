# Shared indicators, references

- When referencing external sources, use citation to give credit to the original author or publisher per [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/legal-content/copyrights-and-trademarks).

  Drop the “https://” or https:// per the style guide.

- Include “defanged” links or references to avoid directing readers to malicious links or websites that we suspect might be malicious. This will allow readers who are familiar with the industry practice of defanging to explore the topic in more detail safely in a sandboxed environment. Defanging URLs and domain names are best practice in the industry. By doing so, even if the resource cannot automatically detonate, we set a good example and show our conscientiousness for best practices.

- URL defanging standard is brackets around the last “.” before the top-level domain (TLD).

  URL example: www.contoso[.]com;

  Domain examples: subdomain.malicious[.]com; malicious[.]com.

- IP address defanging standard is brackets around the “.” preceding the fourth octet.

  IP address examples: 192.168.1[.]1

- Best practice includes archiving press articles that we do NOT want to direct readers to. This would include Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, and Russian state-linked media, or suspected state-linked media, websites.

- Verify the accuracy and credibility of any sources you reference.
