# Know your audience

There are different kinds of consumers of threat intelligence. Some are external, and some are paying customers. For external cybersecurity and threat intelligence writing, follow the guidelines set forth by the Microsoft Writing Style Guide for tone, voice, and style, in addition to some of the special considerations included in this guide. Customers who use Microsoft's threat intelligence might include:

**Microsoft internal audiences**: This can include Microsoft Digital Security & Resilience (formerly ISRM), Microsoft Incident Response (formerly DART), Regional Security Managers, many in the sales field (Technical Sales Professionals and Global Blackbelts), CO+I, CELA, and others. Communicating with consistent tone, voice, and style internally increases the likelihood that our cybersecurity and threat intelligence work will be communicated in that way externally.

**Defenders/Cybersecurity practitioners:** These are the folks who use the products on a day-to-day basis and using the information we publish to hunt for threats in their environments.

**Cybersecurity researchers:** Cybersecurity researchers may use Microsoft's threat intelligence to gain insights into the latest cyberthreats and vulnerabilities. Microsoft provides access to its threat intelligence feeds and other resources for cybersecurity researchers.

**IT security press:** This is an important segment of the audience for TI blogs because some of our blogs are shared with the press on embargo before publication.

**Enterprise organizations:** Large companies and organizations may use Microsoft's threat intelligence to protect their networks and data from cyberthreats. Microsoft provides a range of security solutions, including endpoint protection, email security, and threat intelligence feeds that can be integrated into existing security systems.

**Government agencies:** Government agencies may use Microsoft's threat intelligence to help protect national security and critical infrastructure from cyberthreats. Microsoft has partnerships with government agencies to share threat intelligence and provide security solutions.

**Managed security service providers (MSSPs):** MSSPs may use Microsoft's threat intelligence to provide security services to their clients. Microsoft provides threat intelligence feeds and other security solutions that can be integrated into MSSP offerings.

**Security vendors:** Other security vendors may use Microsoft's threat intelligence to enhance their own security products and services. Microsoft provides APIs and other integration options to allow third-party security vendors to access its threat intelligence feeds and other security resources.
