# How we talk about threat intelligence

Overall, Microsoft's threat intelligence is designed to be flexible and adaptable, with a range of options for different types of customers to integrate and use the threat intelligence in their own security systems and processes while at the same time promoting clear, efficient, and effective communication that is consistent with Microsoft voice and tone, style, TI standards, aside from industry-accepted standards.

- We have unified our threat intelligence initiatives and brand under one name, "Microsoft Threat Intelligence," reserving the team names such as Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Threat Analysis Center (DTAC) primarily for internal communications as well as specific customer communications.
- We refer to us as *Microsoft Threat Intelligence* or *we*, and them as *you* or *your team*.
