# Countries and regions

If you’re referring to a country or region, please refer to these guidelines from Global Readiness:

- [Official country/region list](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness/SitePages/Official-Country-Region-List.aspx)
- [Using the country/region list](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness/SitePages/1069.aspx)
- [Use “country/region” not “country” (sharepoint.com)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness/SitePages/1000.aspx)

Consult the section about geographical and political borders when talking about regions or countries.

- **Don’t use:** Russia targeted the United States more than any other country.
- **Do use:** Russian state actors targeted entities in the United States more than in any other country. 

See specific guidance in [Demographics language: How to talk about groups of people](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\demographics-language-how-to-talk-about-groups-of-people.md).
