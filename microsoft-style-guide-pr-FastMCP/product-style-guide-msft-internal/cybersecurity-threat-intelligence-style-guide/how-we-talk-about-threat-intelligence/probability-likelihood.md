# Probability, likelihood

### Conveying probability and likelihood

It is important for threat intelligence analysts to clearly communicate the likelihood of the occurrence of an event or development. Degrees of likelihood encompass a full spectrum from remote to almost certainly. Consistency in the terms used and the supporting information is critical to success in expressing degrees of likelihood. Microsoft uses the same guideline published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for analytic standards.

| Probability/ Likelihood                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Almost certainly**                     | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 95-99% (no prediction is ever 100% certain) |
| **Highly probable/highly likely**        | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 80-95%              |
| **Probably/likely**                      | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 55-80%              |
| **Possibly/roughly even odds**           | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 45-55%              |
| **Improbable/unlikely**                  | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 20-45%              |
| **Highly improbable/highly unlikely**    | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 5-20%               |
| **Remote/almost no chance**              | This means that the probability of occurrence is between 1-5%                |
