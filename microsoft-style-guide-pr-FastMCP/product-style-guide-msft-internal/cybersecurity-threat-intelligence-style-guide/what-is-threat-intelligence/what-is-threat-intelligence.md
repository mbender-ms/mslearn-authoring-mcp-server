# What is threat intelligence?

Threat intelligence is threat information and/or data that has been collected, aggregated, analyzed, and disseminated about cyber threats that could help inform decision-making. At Microsoft, we believe threat intelligence is a necessary component of any cybersecurity ecosystem. By monitoring and analyzing the latest threat trends and sharing this information with the world, especially with our customers and partners, we can help better protect people and their data, and prevent cyberattacks.

Our threat intelligence analysts use a variety of tools and techniques to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. We analyze data from multiple sources, including internal telemetry, external threat feeds, and open-source intelligence, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape. Through collaboration with our customers, partners, and industry peers, we can share insights and best practices, and work together to mitigate threats as well as the impact of cyberattacks.
