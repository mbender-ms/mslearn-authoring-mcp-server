# Uses of threat intelligence

**Intended uses:** The primary and intended uses of threat intelligence include threat detection and response, incident response, and vulnerability management. This type of threat intelligence is typically used by security teams to identify and mitigate potential cyber threats.

**Sensitive uses:** These uses require a higher level of confidentiality and sensitivity, such as national security or law enforcement investigations. Sensitive uses of threat intelligence require strict controls and protocols to protect the privacy and security of the information.

**Unsupported uses:** These uses are not recommended or supported by the provider of the intelligence. Unsupported uses may include using threat intelligence for offensive purposes or making decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information.

**Restricted uses:** These uses are subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, such as restrictions on sharing intelligence with foreign entities or using intelligence for commercial purposes. Restricted uses require compliance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that the information is used appropriately and ethically.
