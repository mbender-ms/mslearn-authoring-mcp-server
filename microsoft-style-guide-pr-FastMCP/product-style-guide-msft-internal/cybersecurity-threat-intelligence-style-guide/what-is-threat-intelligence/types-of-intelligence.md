# Types of intelligence

**Finished intelligence:** Information that’s been collected, synthesized, analyzed, reviewed, and published in a report. This type of report usually involves multiple sources and is coordinated and reviewed before it’s disseminated to stakeholders.  

**Human intelligence (HUMINT):** Raw, unfinished information clandestinely derived from human sources. Microsoft doesn’t collect HUMINT for finished intelligence products.  

**Open-source intelligence (OSINT):** Information collected from publicly available sources such as social media posts, press articles, research papers and publications, criminal records, and more.  

**Raw intelligence:** Information that’s been gathered but has not yet been analyzed.  

**Activity group:** A clustered set of intrusion data that shares similar tightly related features or characteristics allowing you to assess activity is related. Many “Storm” clusters tracked by Microsoft are not actors, but rather are technical clusters of data that may/may-not be tied to existing threat actors.
