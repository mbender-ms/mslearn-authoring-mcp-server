# target

**target**: An account, network, individual, or organization that was targeted, but not compromised to our knowledge, by a user that did not have privileged access in an effort to gain access. We use “target” when a successful outcome or compromise cannot be confirmed.

This is different from a victim.

**victim**: An account, network, individual, or organization that has been compromised.
