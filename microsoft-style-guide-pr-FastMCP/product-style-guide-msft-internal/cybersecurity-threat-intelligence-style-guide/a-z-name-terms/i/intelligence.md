# intelligence

**Finished intelligence:** Information that’s been collected, synthesized, analyzed, reviewed, and published in a report. This type of report usually involves multiple sources and is coordinated and reviewed before it’s disseminated to stakeholders. 

**Human intelligence (HUMINT):** Raw, unfinished information clandestinely derived from human sources. Microsoft doesn’t collect HUMINT for finished intelligence products.

**Open-source intelligence (OSINT):** Information collected from publicly available sources such as social media posts, press articles, research papers and publications, criminal records, and more.

**Raw intelligence:** Information that’s been gathered but has not yet been analyzed.
