# Welcome

Welcome to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Style Guide! This guide is designed to provide a set of guidelines and best practices for writing threat intelligence.

This guide is intended for anyone at Microsoft in the cybersecurity or threat intelligence community who writes content, for either internal or external audiences. If you are an analyst, you may be responsible for analyzing threat information to help protect Microsoft's customers from cyberthreats. When putting your analysis in written form, you must be able to clearly and accurately communicate, not only your assessments, but the context around them. Effective communication is critical to ensure that your findings are understood and acted upon quickly. This guide provides a framework for creating clear, concise, and consistent content that meets the needs of your audience.

The style guide covers a range of topics, including writing style, citation and attribution, security, and privacy. The guide is meant to supplement the [*Microsoft Writing Style Guide*](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/welcome) which provides guidance on approved Microsoft style and voice. Follow the guidelines in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide for any topic not covered here.

Additionally, the guide incorporates inclusive language: recommended word choices to advance our global cybersecurity and threat intelligence community. The language we use plays a part in fostering healthy and diverse teams. Aiming for an inclusive culture in the fields of cybersecurity and threat intelligence will help to attract and retain much needed diverse talent to the industry.

Some of the elements and content in this style guide are included to provide context about the tradecraft of threat intelligence and are not necessarily typical of what you will find in a writing style guide. In this context, we take the topics a little deeper to provide more information and clarity of understanding about the writing conventions offered.

Thank you for your commitment to protecting Microsoft's customers, partners, and the public and private sectors from cyberthreats. We hope this guide helps you communicate more effectively and impactfully in the vital role you play to secure people and their data from undue harm.
