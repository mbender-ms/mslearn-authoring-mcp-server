# Other Microsoft style references

In addition to the Microsoft Cybersecurity + Threat Intelligence Style Guide, the references below are useful when you're working on content for cybersecurity and threat intelligence. 

Don't rely on any Microsoft website, product UI, documentation, or localization resources in place of this guide for questions of style, product names, capping, terminology, or proper usage.

Note that if a term is in [The American Heritage Dictionary](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=), it's not duplicated in our style guides. So if you don’t find a term in this style guide or the [*Microsoft Writing Style Guide*](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/welcome), check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://www.ahdictionary.com/).
