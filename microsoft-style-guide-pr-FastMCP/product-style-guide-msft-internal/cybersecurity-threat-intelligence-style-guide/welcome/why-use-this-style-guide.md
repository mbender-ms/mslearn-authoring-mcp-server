# Why use this style guide?

Consistency in communication across all Microsoft properties is an important component of the “One Microsoft” strategy. This strategy links our offerings into one holistic ecosystem that ensures all customer-facing content aligns with our brand and tone. The trick is to stand up with Microsoft, not stand out. In other words, we should differentiate ourselves from our competitors in these spaces, not from Microsoft. When our whole ecosystem works together and lives up to the Microsoft brand, both we and our customers benefit. To that end, all Microsoft employees and vendors producing content should be consistent in following writing style guidelines and become familiar with voice, style, and approved terminology.
