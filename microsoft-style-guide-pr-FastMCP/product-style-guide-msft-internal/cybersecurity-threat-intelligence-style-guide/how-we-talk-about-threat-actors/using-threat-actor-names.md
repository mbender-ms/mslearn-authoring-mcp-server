# Using threat actor names

Refer to [How Microsoft names threat actors](/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/microsoft-threat-actor-naming?view=o365-worldwide) for details on the recently rolled out threat actor naming convention.

**First-party content**

Content produced by Microsoft Threat Intelligence based on first-party analysis should always use the Microsoft threat actor taxonomy name to identify the actor(s) referenced. These should be introduced in the opening of the content and any relevant, approved third-party names that overlap with Microsoft Threat Intelligenceâ€™s perspective on the actor can be listed as helpful context. Where obvious, use the most well-known third-party names and aim for three or less.

These third-party aliases should only be referred to as overlapping names, never as a direct one-to-one mapping. As previously [noted](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CTIWritingStyleGuide/Shared%20Documents/General/Drafts/Draft1_Cybersecurity%20+%20Threat%20Intelligence%20Writing%20Style%20Guide.docx#_How_we_talk), all public attribution statements must be tracked and approved within Microsoft Threat Intelligence and have supporting collateral stored in the approved knowledgebase (e.g., Spectre).

**OSINT content**

Where we are sharing OSINT content (e.g., in the MDTI portal) and have not enriched or corroborated the attribution, only the existing third-party actor name should be used.
