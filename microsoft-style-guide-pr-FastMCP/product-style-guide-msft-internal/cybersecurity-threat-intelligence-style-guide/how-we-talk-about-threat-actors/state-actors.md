# State actors

State threat actors are characterized by their links to the government of the state from which or on whose behalf they operate.

1. Wherever a government has made a public attribution of a threat group to a known government or other real-world entity, reference it and link to that statement.
2. There are important distinctions between [Country adjective] state actors, [Country]-affiliated actors, and [Country]-based actors:

| Topic | Example | Explanation |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **[Country adjective]** state actor | "Russian state actor" "Iranian state actor" "Chinese state actor" | Use when referring to an actor that Microsoft has assessed falls under the government’s chain of command. We should consistently use this taxonomy in all written references and avoid using other variations as much as possible (e.g., "nation state actor", "government actor", "nation state hackers"). Atlantic Council categories: state-integrated, state-executed |
| **[Country]-affiliated** actor/activity | "Russia-affiliated actor/activity" "Iran-affiliated actor" "North Korea-affiliated actor" | Use when referring to a group that we lack sufficient supporting evidence to link to the state itself or its chain of command, but one whose operations we assess support a state’s national interests and is coordinated with or supported by the state. This covers a wide span of actors. Atlantic Council categories: state-rogue-conducted, state-ordered, state-coordinated, state-shaped, state-encouraged). |
| **[Country]-based** actor/activity | "Russia-based actor/activity" "China-based actor" "North Korea-based actor" “Iran-based ransomware actor” | Use when we lack sufficient information to determine whether an actor is a state group or state-aligned. All we can determine is that the group operates out of a given country and their targeting or TTPs align with a state-aligned or state group. For other actors (crime/ransomware, cyber mercenaries) - use as a geographic location identifier when referring to an actor or activity that is not affiliated state actors. Atlantic Council categories: state-ignored |
| **[Country adjective]**-sponsored actors | “Russian state-sponsored actors” “North Korean state-sponsored actors” | Use to refer to a mix of state actors and state-affiliated actors. |
