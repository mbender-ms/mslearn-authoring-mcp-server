# How we talk about threat actors

Microsoft tracks and reports on a variety of threat actors. These can be divided at a high level into four areas: state, criminal, private-sector offensive actors (PSOA), and authorized offensive actors (AOA). The sections below will define[^1] the threat actor subtypes within each of these areas.

Attribution to an entity or state requires rigorous analysis and must be approved/tracked within Microsoft Threat Intelligence[^2]. Microsoft should not assume attribution or leverage attribution statements of external entities without individual analysis or corroboration.

In some cases, it may be necessary to combine terms from multiple sections below. In those cases, refer to the state affiliation first, followed by the additional term – e.g., "Iran-affiliated ransomware actor”.

[^1]: Where possible, Microsoft will map our preferred term to one or more categories in [the Atlantic Council’s “Spectrum of State Responsibility”](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/022212_ACUS_NatlResponsibilityCyber.PDF#:~:text=The%20spectrum%20of%20state%20responsibility%20is%20a%20tool,national%20government%20actually%20planning%20and%20executing%20an%20attack.) tool.
