# Language to avoid

- **Marketing language when writing about sensitive topics**: The message and positioning of content about serious and sensitive topics (such as the war in Ukraine) should be toned down to reflect the seriousness and gravity of the subject matter. Don’t use language that evokes sensationalism like “Get the latest and greatest on XYZ” when writing about topics involving harm to victims and targets. Be careful not to appear to benefit from activity that is putting others at grave risk.

  Example:

  **Don’t use:** Get trends and insights from year one of the war in Ukraine

  **Use instead**: A year of hybrid warfare in Ukraine

- **Jargon and technical terms**: Avoid using technical terms and jargon that may be unfamiliar to your audience. If you must use technical terms, provide definitions and context. Even words whose meaning may seem obvious to you may be new to your reader.

- **Colloquialisms and slang**: Avoid using colloquialisms and slang in your writing, as they may be misinterpreted or unclear to your audience.

- **Ambiguous language**: Avoid using language that is vague or ambiguous. Be specific and clear in your writing to ensure that your meaning is understood.

- **Biased language**: Avoid using language that is biased or subjective. Use objective language and avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.

- **Emotive language**: Avoid using emotional language that may be interpreted as alarmist or sensationalist. State the facts and avoid exaggerating the severity of the threat.

- **Abbreviations and acronyms**: Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms unless they’re widely understood and necessary for brevity. If you must use an abbreviation or acronym, define it first.

- **Inconsistent language**: Avoid using inconsistent language that may confuse your audience. Use consistent terminology and avoid using multiple terms to refer to the same thing.

- Where possible, avoid writing the Microsoft Threat Intelligence marketing handle with “Microsoft Threat” on one line and “Intelligence” below it.

  Examples:

  **Do use:**  
  Microsoft Threat Intelligence

  **Don’t use:**  
  Microsoft Threat  
  Intelligence

  **Use this instead, if space is limited:**  
  Microsoft  
  Threat Intelligence
