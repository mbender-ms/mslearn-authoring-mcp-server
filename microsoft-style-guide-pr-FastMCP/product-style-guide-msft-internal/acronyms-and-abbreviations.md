# Acronyms and abbreviations

## Don't turn any name into an acronym (or use an acronym or abbreviation in a name)

No Microsoft product or feature name may be turned into an acronym or abbreviation (or use either in the name). That means no *MS, MSFT, ML, MR, AR, VR, CDS, VSO, CDM, CDN, AAD, ARM, MAM, Quick Calcs, Mgmt,* and so on. There are only a handful of approved exceptions to this rule in our names (noted in individual A–Z name entries in this style guide).

Why? Turning product names into acronyms or abbreviating words undermines our brand marketing efforts and can also create legal risks:

- Our product naming strategy is descriptive. Microsoft names strategically utilize words that literally describe what it is, what it does, or how it works. Truncating those hard-working names into acronyms obscures any meaning and requires that to tell the same story, we must then invest in more marketing, more messages, more words.

- Full words are both human and search engine friendly which will help in driving quality traffic to your site, service, or content.

- Product names can make for high-performing keywords. When your audience is at the end of the buying cycle they’ll be searching for a specific product or service. People evaluating solutions for the first time are less likely to use or recognize acronyms, impeding discovery and conversion.

- Customers don't expect significant product names to be shorthanded to an acronym and might mistake it for a lower-level technology or feature.

- Our target audiences must translate an acronym in their mind every time they encounter it, rather than engaging fully with the larger story we're telling.

- Legally, acronyms in product UI could be considered a product or a feature name, exposing Microsoft to potential trademark risk.

- Other organizations, products, or services may be using the same acronym, causing confusion and legal risk.

  - Abbreviations tend to be owned trademarks, exposing Microsoft to potential trademark risk.

  - To avoid jeopardizing Microsoft's own trademark rights, don't abbreviate or create acronyms out of trademarks.

## Truncation is the solution

In product UI, if an app or feature name is too long for a particular space, it will truncate automatically. For example, "Dynamics 365 Foo Manag ..." Microsoft Design System follows the industry norm to truncate, and users are familiar with that interaction pattern. We don't condense product or feature names by with abbreviations or by removing spaces. Doing so can cause accessibility issues for users with screen readers as well. (The same applies in localized products.)

## How to use acronyms and other abbreviations (outside of names)

Outside of names, to maximize clarity we use acronyms, initialisms, and other abbreviations sparingly. Any permissible industry-standard abbreviation or acronym should still be spelled out (and explained as necessary) on first mention. Make sure the abbreviation or acronym logically corresponds with the full name and the full name isn't being contrived in such a way just to form a unique acronym.

**First mention**

In general, spell out acronyms on first mention, and include the acronym in parentheses immediately following the expanded form. On subsequent mention on the same surface (in the same screen, pane, topic, or article), you can use the acronym without spelling it out.

If the first mention appears in a title or heading, use your best judgment to determine how much information to include. For example, if space is limited, use the acronym without spelling it out. If the acronym and its spelled-out form are both important keywords, include them both in a title or heading to optimize their exposure to search engines. In the first sentence after the title or heading, provide the expanded form followed by the acronym in parentheses. (Remember, don't use an acronym in place of a product, services, or brand name.)

## Articles and plurals

Choose an indefinite article (*a* or *an*) based on the acronym's pronunciation.

an SDK  
an OEM

The rules for plurals and possessives of abbreviations are the same rules as those for full words. If an acronym represents a singular noun, add a lowercase s to make it plural. Don't add an apostrophe before the *s.* If an acronym already represents a plural noun, don't add an *s*.

## Globalization considerations

In machine-translated content, be careful with acronyms that form common English words such as *RAM* (*random access memory*) and *NAP* (*network access point*). If such a word appears in text without the parentheses and without the object that it stands for, it might be translated according to its dictionary definition.
