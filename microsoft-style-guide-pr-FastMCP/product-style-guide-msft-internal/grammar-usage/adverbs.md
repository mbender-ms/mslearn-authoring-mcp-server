# Adverbs

**In general, avoid adverbs,** which are words that describe how, when, or where by modifying other words like verbs and adjectives. Adverbs are often—though not always—words that end in *-ly.* They’re often unnecessary, so unless they're important to the meaning of the text, leave them out.

**Examples of adverbs**  
quite  
very  
quickly  
easily  
effectively

Organizations need a new security model that more effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern hybrid cloud environment.

**When you do use adverbs, keep them close to the words they modify.** You can accidentally change the meaning of your message by placing them too far away from the words that they belong with. Plus, following this guideline makes your writing easier to understand by people who don’t speak English fluently.
