# Contractions

Using common contractions is an easy way to make your writing sound warm and relaxed. (For more information about “warm and relaxed,” and Microsoft’s other voice principles, see [Microsoft’s brand voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.)

- Use common contractions, such as:
  - aren’t
  - can’t
  - couldn’t
  - didn’t
  - doesn’t
  - don’t
  - hasn’t 
  - haven’t
  - isn’t
  - it’s
  - shouldn’t
  - that’s
  - there’s
  - wasn’t
  - weren’t
  - what's
  - won’t
  - wouldn’t
  - you'll
  - you’re
  - you’ve

- Be careful not to confuse *it’s* (the contraction for *it is*) and *its* (the possessive pronoun).
- Don’t mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in the same block of text. For example, don’t use *can’t* and *cannot* in the same error message.
- Don’t use the contraction for *that is* when you're using it to mean *in other words.*
- Don’t use uncommon contractions, such as *there’d, there’ll, how’d, it’ll,* and so on. These can be ambiguous or hard to understand.
- Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb. In particular, never form a contraction using *Microsoft* or a product name, as in "Microsoft’s offering a limited-time discount" or "Sway’s now integrated with the Microsoft Photos app."
