# Spaces

Use only one space between sentences—that is, after periods, question marks, and exclamation marks—and after colons.  
Don’t put spaces on either side of a dash.

**Exception**  
In ranges in the UI, put one space on either side of the en dash for legibility:

**Examples [in the UI]**  
10:45 AM – 6:30 PM  
2:15 AM 12/1/14 – 4:45 PM 4/1/14

For times, insert a space between the numeral and *AM/PM,* as in *2 PM.*

**See** [Hyphens](~\punctuation\hyphens.md), [Dashes](~\punctuation\dashes.md), [Time and date ranges](~\grammar-usage\time-day-date\time-and-date-ranges.md), [AM, PM](~\grammar-usage\am-pm.md)
