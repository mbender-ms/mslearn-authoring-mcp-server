# Lists

Choose the right kind of list for the subject matter. Use numbered lists only when the listed items are truly sequential, such as steps in a procedure. Use bulleted lists when you just need to itemize a group of like items.

If the information is complex and your list is becoming unwieldy, consider using a table. Tables can be particularly useful for content like comparisons of plans and their corresponding services or price lists.

If you're using a phrase or sentence to introduce the list, include a colon. However, if the list is immediately preceded by a heading, never end the heading with a colon. When a colon does introduce a bulleted list:

- If one or more list elements completes the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every element.

- If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don’t end the elements with periods, even if they form a complete sentence together with the list introduction.

- If one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element.

Items in the list should be left-aligned. Align the bullet or number flush left with the paragraph; don’t indent it. Use sentence-style capping for each item in the list.

Make sure the items in the list have a consistent, parallel structure. They should all be short phrases or all complete sentences.

Unless they are all complete sentences, don’t use end punctuation for each item in the list. If punctuation is necessary for clarity, make sure punctuation is used consistently in the list and in other lists within the same section or on the same screen or page.
