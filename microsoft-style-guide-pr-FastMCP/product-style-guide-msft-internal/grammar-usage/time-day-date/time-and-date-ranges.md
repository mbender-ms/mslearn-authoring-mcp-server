# Time and date ranges

**Schedules**

Time and date ranges follow this format in a schedule or event copy:

June 1 to September 8, 2020  
December 30, 2019 to January 2, 2020  
(or December 30 to January 2 if context is clear and shelf life is short)

**In product**

Time and date ranges follow this format in UI:  
2:15 AM 12/1/17 â€“ 4:45 PM 4/1/17

Note: This is the one exception where there should be one space on either side of the en dash.
