# Time ranges

In text, it’s preferable to use *to* with a range of times.

<strong>Our style</strong>   
10 AM to 2 PM  
1:30 to 3:00 PM  

In content like invitations, event agendas, or course listings, use an en dash (–) with no space on either side in the time range. Also OK in interfaces.

<strong>Our style</strong>   
8–8:30 AM  
Why companies are adopting the cloud        10 AM–2 PM  
All-hand's meeting: April 24, 3–5 PM
