# Time zones

Capitalize the names of time zones. In general, don’t specify *standard time* and *daylight time*, which refer to clock settings within a time zone at specific times of the year.

**Our style**  
Central Time  
Eastern Time  
Coordinated Universal Time  
Pacific Time

**Not our style**  
Central Daylight Time  
eastern time  
eastern standard time  
Pacific time

Don’t abbreviate the names of time zones, such as *PT*, *ET*, and *UTC* (for Coordinated Universal Time), unless space is severely limited.

Some time zone names can be ambiguous. For example, North America and Australia both have an Eastern Time zone. Unless you’re creating a generic example, where an actual geographic location isn’t relevant, be clear which time zone you mean. The simplest way to do so is to denote an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) that uses standard (not daylight) time. In this case, it’s OK to use the abbreviation UTC. Note: There are no spaces in the UTC offset.

**Our style**  
Eastern Time (UTC-5)  
Eastern Time (UTC+10)

Not all time zones have names. When you need to indicate the time in a time zone without a name, refer to the offset from Coordinated Universal Time.

For more information about referring to time zones, see [Date and time terms](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/date-time-terms) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*.
