# Units of time + abbreviations in the UI

For simplicity and user clarity, consistently use the following abbreviations in tables (grids), charts, and metric labels that appear in the UI. Don't add an *s* to pluralize. However, if a unit of time appears in a sentence, spell out the word.

|   **Term**   | **Singular** | **Plural** |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| millisecond  | 1 ms         | 2 ms       |
| second       | 1 sec        | 2 sec      |
| minute       | 1 min        | 2 min      |
| hour         | 1 h          | 2 h        |
| day          | 1 d          | 2 d        |
| week         | 1 wk         | 2 wk       |
| month        | 1 mo         | 2 mo       |
| year         | 1 yr         | 2 yr       |

In UI, when you're indicating the time since an event occurred, use this pattern (no plurals):

6Â sec ago  
2 min ago  
14 h ago  
5 d ago  
3 wk ago  
2 mo ago  
1+ yr ago

**Note:** Don't precede the time since event with *Modified, Last modified,* or *Saved.* Instead of repeating that in each entry, use *Modified* for example as the column header.
