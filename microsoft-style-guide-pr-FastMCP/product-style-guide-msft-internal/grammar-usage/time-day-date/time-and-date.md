# Time and date

Follow the time of day guidance and use a comma to separate the time from the date. Format the date as month/day/year: XX/XX/XX. Don't use leading zeros in the month or day. (This is for US markets only. Localization will change the date format to reflect what's used most commonly in that area/region.)

In general, follow this format in UI: 4:36 PM, 2/22/17

Flipping the order is also acceptable when the the date is more important than the time of day: 2/22/17, 4:36 PM
