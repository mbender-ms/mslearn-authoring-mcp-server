# Verbs

In general, use simple verbs whenever possible. Try to use the present tense, active voice, and indicative mood.

**Do** If you lose your laptop, your data might be at risk. Kaizala automatically aggregates and presents all the responses in an easy-to-view report. 

**Don’t** If you were to lose your laptop, your data might be at risk. All received responses are automatically aggregated and presented in an easy-to-view report. 

In particular, use the future tense (compounds formed with *will*) only when you need to communicate that an action is conditional or you need to emphasize that it will happen in the future. 

**Do** Microsoft 365 Defender takes automatic action to prevent or stop the attack.  The top-level Microsoft 365 Defender APIs enable you to automate workflows based on the shared incident and advanced hunting tables.  After the migration is complete, each user who has an on-premises Exchange mailbox also will be a new user in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. But you'll still have to assign licenses to users whose mailboxes are migrated.

**Don’t** Microsoft 365 Defender will take automatic action to prevent or stop the attack.  The top-level Microsoft 365 Defender APIs will enable you to automate workflows based on the shared incident and advanced hunting tables.  After the migration is complete, each user who has an on-premises Exchange mailbox is also a new user in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. But you still have to assign licenses to users whose mailboxes are migrated.

Use *can* to describe actions or tasks that the user or app is able to do. Use *might* to express possibility. But avoid *may,* which can sound like we’re giving the user permission to do something.

**Do** You can use the **/b** option to force a black-and-white screen display. You might receive incorrect results when you run a query in SQL. The form might not be displayed.

**Don’t** You may use the **/b** option to force a black-and-white screen display. You may receive incorrect results when you run a query in SQL. The form may not be displayed.
