# Product name use

Microsoft takes more than a thousand offerings to market. To build the customer’s familiarity with the names we’re trying to market to them, we take extra care with how product names appear in our communications.

Key to protecting the integrity of our product names is to use them in their correct form, without modification. Specifically:

- Don’t use product names in the plural (unless the correct form of the name is plural).
