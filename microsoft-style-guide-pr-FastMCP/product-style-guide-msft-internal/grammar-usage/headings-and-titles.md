# Headings and titles

The most important guideline for writing headings and titles is to describe, in the customers’ own language, what they need to know or want to do. Don’t rely on Microsoft jargon or marketing talking points that don’t reflect the actual customer experience. When you divide content into subsections, try to have at least two subheadings. This is especially true in longer pieces, such as white papers or customer testimonials. In shorter content such as webpages, it’s OK to have only one subsection within a section if other methods—such as restructuring or changing the formatting—won’t present the content as clearly. 

Use a heading style that matches the content being introduced: 

- If the material includes information about a task, use imperative clauses that include “command” verbs.

- For procedures, use an infinitive phrase.

- In material that gives background or overview information rather than describes a task, use a simple noun phrase.

- In general, use singular nouns in your headings. This makes the most sense to users, because from their point of view, they’re interested only in the task at hand, not the subject in a general sense. It’s OK to use a plural noun when the plural is obviously more suitable.

- Within a section or on the same page, make all headings at the same level parallel in structure. That is, they should all be imperative clauses, simple noun phrases, or infinitive phrases.

- Employ SEO in headings and titles on the web.
  - Know the terms that customers use to search for your information, and use those keywords early in the title.
  - Limit page titles to 10 to 12 words, or about 65 characters.

- Don’t use periods at the end of titles and headings. Question marks and exclamation marks can be used if necessary for meaning.

- Use sentence-style capitalization for titles and headings. Sentence-style capitalization means you capitalize the first letter of the first word only—the rest of the heading is lowercase. Of course, capitalize any proper noun that appears within the title or heading, too.

- Spell out *and* in headings and titles. Don’t use the ampersand (&) or plus sign (+). For guidelines about the word *and* in the UI, see [plus sign](~\a_z_names_terms\number-symbols\plus-sign.md).

- In the first sentence following any heading or title, don’t assume that the reader has read the heading.
