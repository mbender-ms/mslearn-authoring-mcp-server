# Preposition choice

English has a lot of phrases that include a preposition, such as interest in and prevent from. It’s tricky to know which is the right preposition to use in such phrases because there are no rules—you just have to learn them.

For content creators who are looking for the correct preposition to use in common English phrases, here are some resources:

- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)—Look at the entry for the main word in the phrase. For example, if you want to know whether you should say *different from* or *different than* or *different to,* look at the topic for *different.*
