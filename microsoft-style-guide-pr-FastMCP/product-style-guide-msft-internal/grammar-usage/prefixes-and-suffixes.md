# Prefixes and suffixes

## Prefixes

Prefixes are terms that are added to the front of an existing word to create a new word. For example, some prefixes that are used frequently in Microsoft content include:

- anti
- auto
- bi
- co
- cyber
- multi
- non
- post
- pre
- re
- sub
- un

When you’re using a word that includes a prefix, check these resources to see whether you should hyphenate the word:

- *[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)*
- the [A–Z list](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide
- the [A–Z list ](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/a-z-word-list-term-collections/) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*

If the word isn’t in any of these resources, avoid creating a new word by adding a prefix to another word. Words formed in this way can sound like jargon and be difficult to understand for people who don’t speak English fluently. Instead, rewrite to clearly say what you mean.

**Our style**  
Automated key rotation in Azure Key Vault allows people to configure Key Vault to automatically generate a new key version at a specified frequency.

**Not our style**  
Key autorotation in Azure Key Vault allows people to configure Key Vault to autogenerate a new key version at a specified frequency.

Words that begin with a prefix are usually spelled as one word, no hyphen.

**Examples**  
antivirus  
multifactor  
autoscale

There are some exceptions:

- When a prefix is used before a capitalized word or a number, include a hyphen.  
  **Examples**  
  pre-2022  
  non-Bluetooth device

- Include a hyphen to separate two i’s, two a’s, or other combinations of vowels that would cause the reader to misunderstand the word.  
  **Examples**  
  bi-integration, *but* bidirectional  
  co-installer, *but* comanage  
  re-render, *but* reenter

- Include a hyphen when omitting the hyphen would form a different word from the one you intend.  
  **Examples**  
  re-cover *vs.* recover  
  re-sent and re-sign *vs.* resent and resign  
  co-op *vs.* coop

## Suffixes

Suffixes are terms that are added to the end of an existing word to create a new word. For example, some suffixes that are used frequently in Microsoft content include:

- free
- like
- wide

**Examples**  
code-free  
enterprise-wide

There aren’t consistent rules for whether a word formed with a suffix is hyphenated, one word, or two words. When you’re using a word that includes a suffix, check these resources to see whether you should hyphenate it:

- *[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)*
- the [A–Z list](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide
- the [A–Z list](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/a-z-word-list-term-collections/) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*

If the word isn’t in any of those resources, rewrite to clearly say what you mean.
