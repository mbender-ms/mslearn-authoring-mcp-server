# Operators

Operators are words that can be used in search engines to get more specific results by applying logic to the terms entered in the search.

Operators include *and*, *not*, and *or*.

**Guidelines**

For best practice, use all-caps: *AND*, *NOT*, *OR*

Using the *AND* operator requires results to include multiple search terms. For example, "washington AND redwoods"

Using the *NOT* operator helps remove irrelevant results. For example, "ice age NOT movie".

Using the *OR* operator broadens a search by allowing results that include either of the search terms entered. For example, "accessibility OR a11y".

For more information, see definition 3 of *operator* in [The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).
