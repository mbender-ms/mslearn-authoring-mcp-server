# Industry terms, industry standard terms

Often content creators are asked to use a term because it’s an “industry term” or "industry standard term." But without data, it can be difficult to know whether it’s legitimate to use a particular term or if the term is jargon that should be avoided.

This topic provides criteria for determining whether a proposed term is actually commonly used and understood. If it's a common industry term, we must still make sure that we use it in a way that’s consistent with Microsoft voice and writing style standards.

## Look in the dictionary and style guides first

Many common, established industry terms are already listed in our existing resources. To determine whether a term is OK to use, look in these resources first:

- [*Microsoft Writing Style Guide*](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/a-z-word-list-term-collections/)
- The list of [A–Z names and terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide
- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) (If *American Heritage* lists alternative spellings for a word, use the first one.)

## What qualifies as an “industry term”?

If a term isn’t in the dictionary or style guides, we can consider it an industry term that's legitimate to use if data validates it meets all these criteria:

- It’s in [widespread use in relevant, authoritative sources](#widespread-use-in-relevant-authoritative-sources).
- It’s not a recent coinage—it’s been in use for a while.
- It’s appropriate for the context and being used in a way that’s [meaningful for the customer](#appropriate-and-meaningful-use).

## Widespread use in relevant, authoritative sources

By “widespread” and “relevant,” we mean there’s evidence that the proposed term appears frequently in a variety of content, and that content is for the same industry or audience that you’re trying to reach. A relevant source could be content about the overall tech industry, DevOps, or AI, or content for a customer segment such as IT admins or business decision makers.

Search data can be helpful in determining whether a term is in *widespread* use, but be sure that the use is also *relevant.* If the term that you want to use is a common Google search term, double-check that the meaning people are searching for is the same as your intended meaning.

**Example**  
*MFA* is a common search term, but Google data has shown that most of the searches are people looking for the *Master of Fine Arts* degree, not *multifactor authentication.* All by itself, prevalence as a search term isn’t evidence that a proposed term meets the requirement of relevant and widespread use.

By “authoritative,” we mean that the sources must be published by reliable organizations that vet and edit their published content.

## Prolonged use

Consider how long the term has been in use. To be considered an industry term, the term has to have staying power.

Unless the business group is pursuing a trademark, a new brand name, or another significant investment in building customer familiarity in this term, coinages should be avoided in product and feature names.

**Example**  
Microsoft intentionally deviated from a more popular term, *augmented reality,* because the term we coined, *mixed reality,* better describes the Microsoft functionality. And Microsoft committed to establishing and standardizing on the term *mixed reality.*

The term shouldn’t be a one-off or something that someone just came up with. The intention must be for the term to be in continuous use for a long time. Jargon is OK if it’s specialized language that’s become established in the industry. (For example, *IoT* is industry jargon.) But if it’s merely a trend—such as *distro* or adding *-Ops* to words—avoid it.

## Appropriate and meaningful use

The people using the term have to agree on what it means. It’s common for a new buzzword to get a lot of press but for different people to use it to mean different things. It’s counterproductive to use a word for which there isn’t a shared understanding. Instead of increasing clarity in the customer message, such terms contribute to the customer’s confusion.

## Industry terms and Microsoft style

If a term meets all three criteria to be considered a common industry term, you need to determine what’s the correct style for it—a term might be used widely in the industry but have no established usage. For example, a term might appear in various reliable sources as *foo, Foo, FOO, foo-foo, F. O. O.,* and so on.

First look in these sources:

- [*Microsoft Writing Style Guide*](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/welcome/)
- The list of [A–Z names + terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) in this style guide
- [*Merriam-Webster Dictionary*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)

If you don’t find guidelines in those three resources for how to use the term, follow general Microsoft style for capitalization, spelling, and hyphenation. In particular, pay attention to these Microsoft style guidelines:

- **Capitalization**—Lowercase. Don’t use camel casing—that is, words written without spaces but with internal capitalization, like this: *CamelCase*—or any other unusual capitalization. See [Capitalization standards](~\capitalization-standards\capitalization-standards.md) for details.
- **Acronyms**—Avoid them. Acronyms can undermine our branding efforts, jeopardize the clarity of our message to the customer, and create legal risks. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
- **Worldwide, bias-free communication**—Is the term free of cultural, gender, and racial bias? Will it be understood by a worldwide English-speaking audience? Remember that many Microsoft customers speak English, but it’s not their first language. For details, see [Respect culture, ethnicity, gender, age, and class](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2696&topicid=55124), [Write to be understood worldwide](~\content-for-a-worldwide-audience\write-to-be-understood-worldwide.md), and [Bias-free communication](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/bias-free-communication) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide.*
- **Numbers**—Follow Microsoft style for using numbers, including [Numerals vs. words](~\numbers\numerals-vs-words.md).
- **Punctuation**—Follow Microsoft style for punctuation, in particular hyphens. See [Hyphens](~\punctuation\hyphens.md) in this guide and [Hyphens](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide.*
