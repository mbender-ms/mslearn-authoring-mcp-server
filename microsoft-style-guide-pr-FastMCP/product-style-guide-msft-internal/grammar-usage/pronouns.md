# Pronouns

In UI, it's preferrable to avoid pronouns in experiences like *Your account* or *My account.* Pronouns can lend to a conversational and friendly voice in UI text, but can also create problems for user comprehension, screen readers, voice commands, and localization. 

If it's possible to be clear, engaging, and helpful without using a pronoun, don't use the pronoun. For example, use *Videos* or *Video collection* rather than *My videos* or *Your videos.*

**Exceptions:**  

When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns that person prefers, whether it's he, she, they, or another pronoun. It's OK to use gendered pronouns (like he, she, his, and hers) when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.  

It's also OK to use gendered pronouns in content such as direct quotations and the titles of works and when gender is relevant, such as discussions about the challenges that women face in the workplace. 

## you, your

In headings, running text, or any non-clickable UI, when the UI is addressing the user, use *you* or *your*. Also, use *you* and *your* in all types of help content.

Avoid using *you* in ways that sound like we're commanding users to do something rather than providing options for them to make their own choices.

**Examples**

- Enter your email address.
- Your PC will restart automatically.
- If you don't need any of your old apps or files, opt for a clean install.

## I, me, my

When customers are making choices about what they want, use the first person (I, me, my). These pronouns are usually used on buttons, links, or anything that a user will select/click/choose.

**Examples**

- Tell me when a new Bluetooth device tries to connect to my PC
- Remember my password

## we

*We* is OK to use to describe an action by our software and services, an action or recommendation by the UI designers, or Microsoft itself.

*We* can help create a more human experience, but don't overuse we. It's not a crutch for appearing conversational, and too much of it diverts attention from users. 

Use *we recommend* rather than *it's recommended*.

**Examples**

- We can't find that printer. Do you want to add a different one?
- We recommend this option.
- We'll only use this info if we need to help you recover your account.
- We recommend that you back up your files on a regular schedule.

## their, they, them

If a pronoun can't be avoided, it's OK to use a plural pronoun (*they*, *their*, or *them*) in a generic reference to a single person. Don't use constructions like *he/she* and *s/he*.

**Example**

- You can see other people's profiles, see their friends, and add them to your friends list.

## he, him, his, she, her, hers

- Don't use as generic references.
- Rewrite to use the second person (you).
- Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
- Use *the* or *a* instead of a pronoun (for example, "the document").
- Refer to a person's role (reader, employee, customer, or client, for example).
- Use *person* or *individual*.
