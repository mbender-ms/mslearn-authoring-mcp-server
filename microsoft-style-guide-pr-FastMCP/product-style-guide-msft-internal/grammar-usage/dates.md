# Dates

In UI, format the date as month/day/year: XX/XX/XX. Don't use leading zeros in the month or day. (This is for US markets only. Localization will change the date format to reflect what's used most commonly in that area/region.) If the time is included, use a comma to separate the time from the date. 

**Our style**  
6/1/16 *[default UI style]*  
3:27 PM, 9/10/16

**Not our style**  
6-1-16 *[in the UI]*  
3:27 PM, Sept. 10, 2016  
09/1016 3:27 PM

Outside the UI, use the following format to indicate a date: *month* *day*, *year*, as in July 31, 2016. Don’t use *day* *month* *year*. Don’t use ordinal numbers (that is, *1st*, *2nd*, *3rd*) to indicate a date. 

**Our style**  
February 16, 2016  
June 21  

**Not our style**  
16 February 2015  
June 21st  
6/1/16  

In content that’s localized for a specific market and will appear only in that market, it’s OK to use the date format that will be familiar to those readers—for example, 21 June 2016 rather than June 21, 2016. 

When you’re referring to dates in body text, include a comma on each side of the year.

To indicate a month and year only, don’t use commas. 

**Our style**  
The new service will become generally available in June 2016.    
The new service will become generally available in June 2016 in the United States.

**Not our style**  
The new service will become generally available in June, 2016.    
The new service will become generally available in June, 2016, in the United States.

Don't use abbreviations for months unless space is limited. If you must abbreviate, use these three-letter abbreviations: *Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov*, and *Dec*. Note that these abbreviations don’t end with a period.
