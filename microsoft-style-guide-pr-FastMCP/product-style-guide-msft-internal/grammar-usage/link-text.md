# Link text

Don’t use *click here* as your link text, which tells audiences nothing about the content that you’re asking them to link to. Instead, all linked text should be descriptive, so that your reader can decide whether to click through.

*Learn more* is OK as link text when it immediately follows a statement, and the target link provides more details about that statement.
