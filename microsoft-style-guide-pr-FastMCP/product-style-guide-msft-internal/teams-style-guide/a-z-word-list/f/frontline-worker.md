# frontline worker

The first point of contact between a company and the outside world. They’re often the first to engage with customers and represent the company’s brand.  

They may also be shift workers or temporary workers.  

**Guidelines**  
- Lowercase.  
- Use primarily in marketing communications. In end-user content for apps like Shifts, use generic terms like people, employees, or workers.  
- Don't use [firstline worker](~/teams-style-guide/a-z-word-list/f/firstline-worker.md).
