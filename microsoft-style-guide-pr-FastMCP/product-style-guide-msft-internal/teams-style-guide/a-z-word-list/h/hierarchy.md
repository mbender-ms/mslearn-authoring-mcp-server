# hierarchy

In the Tasks app, a hierarchy is a tree-like representation of a company's structure from corporate headquarters to individual stores/offices created in a file by an IT admin.

The hierarchy is used by corporate operations managers or planners to choose which areas or stores will receive published tasks.
