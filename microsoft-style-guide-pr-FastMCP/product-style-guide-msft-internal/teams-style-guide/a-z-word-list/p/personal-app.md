# personal app

The app capability that lets you use an app outside a chat or channel. Sometimes it functions like a private workspace, other times it offers a bird’s eye view of everything that’s yours when the app has been configured as a tab in multiple channels.

Access any app with personal app capability from the overflow menu on the app bar.

**Guidelines**

- Use minimally.
- In support content, avoid calling an app a *personal app*. It’s confusing because app capabilities are not exclusive. An app with personal app capability can have tab and/or bot capability, too.
- Instead, say "in the app’s personal view" as a way to write around it.
