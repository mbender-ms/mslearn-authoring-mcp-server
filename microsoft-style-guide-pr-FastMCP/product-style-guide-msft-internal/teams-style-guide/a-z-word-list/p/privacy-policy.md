# privacy policy

The link text to use when linking to a third-party app’s privacy guidelines. For example: "By using Jira Cloud, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of use."

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: privacy policy
- Never privacy statement or any other variations you might find on a third-party landing page.
- It’s OK to use just *Privacy* with a capital P in standalone links when space is tight.
