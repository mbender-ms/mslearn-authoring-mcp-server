# post in multiple channels

To post a message in more than one channel using the *Post in multiple channels* feature in the channel compose box.

**Guidelines**

- Say post *in* multiple channels, not post *to* multiple channels.
- While we do refer to cross-posts and cross-posting in help documentation, donâ€™t use *cross-post* or *cross-posting* in the UI.
