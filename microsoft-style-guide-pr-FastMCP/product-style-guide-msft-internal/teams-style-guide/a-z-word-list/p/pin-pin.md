# Pin, pin

The button or command indicated by a pin icon that puts whatever youâ€™re pinning (an app, channel, chat, messaging extension, etc.) in a visible, easy-to-access location. 

**Guidelines**  
- As a verb, use *pin* to describe an action taken by selecting the command accompanied by the pin icon or the word Pin (Pin to top).  
- Don't use "pin a file to a tab" (instead use, "add a tab," "make a file a tab," or "turn a file or app into a tab," etc.).
