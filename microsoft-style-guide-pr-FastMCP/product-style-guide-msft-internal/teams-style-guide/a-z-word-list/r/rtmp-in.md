# RTMP-In

A meeting option that allows organizers to send a live or previously recorded media stream into a meeting using Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).

RTMP-In must be turned on for the meeting organizer via Teams meeting policy.

**Guidelines**

- “RTMP-In video stream” is acceptable to use.  
- "Streaming mode” or “experience” should not be used without clarifying it’s RTMP-In if that’s the case.
