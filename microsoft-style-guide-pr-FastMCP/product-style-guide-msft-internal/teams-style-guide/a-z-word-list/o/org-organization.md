# org, organization

The tenant; also, the company/group using Teams. An org is different from an account. 

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: org, organization
- Never use *tenant* in end-user copy. 
- In Teams for Work, the more casual *org* is preferred, but *organization* can be used when more clarity is needed. 
- In Microsoft Teams (free), use *organization* instead to reduce confusion for those who might not understand the abbreviated *org*.
- **Example**: Some people in your chat are outside your *org*.
