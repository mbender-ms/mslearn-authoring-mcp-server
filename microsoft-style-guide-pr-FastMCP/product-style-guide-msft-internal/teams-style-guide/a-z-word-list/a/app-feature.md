# app feature

Broad app functionality associated with a particular extension point in Teams. The term app feature replaced the legacy term capability. 

The current app features available in Teams are:  
- Tab  
- Bot  
- Messaging  
- Meeting  
- Connector  
- Personal app  
- Calendar capability*  

**Guidelines**  

- Lowercase  
- Use *app feature* instead of *capability*  

*Calendar capability is only available in one app, Bookings, and is not mentioned along with the others in product and most documentation because it is so rare. It maintains the word capability as part of its term to avoid confusion with the Teams calendar itself.
