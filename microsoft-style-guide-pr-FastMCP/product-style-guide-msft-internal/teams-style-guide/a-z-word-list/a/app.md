# app

Software that extends the functionality of Teams. 
 
**Guidelines**  

- All mentions: app or apps  
- Donâ€™t use *app* when describing first-party apps (Calls, Meetings, or Chat, Teams) that appear in the app bar or are core areas of Teams.  
- It is OK to refer to third-party apps as *apps*.
- **Example**: Open the Shifts *app* or get the Trello *app* for Teams.
