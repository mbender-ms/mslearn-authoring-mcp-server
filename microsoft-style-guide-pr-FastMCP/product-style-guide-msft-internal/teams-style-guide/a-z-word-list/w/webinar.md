# webinar

A meeting template where attendees can interact via turning on their cameras, mics, and/or chat, at the discretion of the organizers.

Webinars currently require attendees to register to attend from an event site.

Webinars and town halls are primarily distinguished by their scale and by the level of interaction available to attendees.
