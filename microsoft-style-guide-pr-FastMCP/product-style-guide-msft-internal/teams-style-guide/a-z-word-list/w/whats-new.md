# What's new (Microsoft Teams)

The end-user announcement of new features and updates to the product. 

It’s published on support.microsoft.com and then pushed to the mobile app and the Help app on desktop. 

*What’s new* is also a command in the Help menu and a tab in the Help app. 

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: What's new  
- Don’t say "release notes" for end users.
