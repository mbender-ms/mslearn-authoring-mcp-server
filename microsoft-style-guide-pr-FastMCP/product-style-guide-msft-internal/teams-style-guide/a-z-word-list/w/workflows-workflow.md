# Workflows, workflow

**Workflows**  
A first-party app in Teams, powered by Power Automate, that lets users run and create simple automations.  

**Guidelines**  
- Title-case.  
- Plural  

**workflow**  
A single automated flow in the Teams Workflows app.  

**Guidelines**  
- Lowercase. It is not a branded term.  
- It’s OK to say "flow" on subsequent usage in long-form content.  
- Don’t use the term "template" in Teams to describe a pre-built workflow, just say *workflow*.  
- While Power Automate has this concept, it’s an unnecessary layer that adds complexity in Teams. If you need to make a distinction, you can say a "custom workflow" or a "workflow built from scratch" (not "create from blank" in Power Automate, which is unfriendly jargon) to talk about workflows that aren’t pre-built templates.  
- Common phrases to use are "create a workflow," "set up a workflow in a channel, meeting, etc.," or "run a workflow."
