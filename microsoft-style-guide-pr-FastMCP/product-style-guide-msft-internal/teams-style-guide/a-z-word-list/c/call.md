# call

A single push-to-talk communication sent to people using the Walkie Talkie app. The call ends when the person stops sending via push-to-talk.

Also, *call* is a video or audio communication between two or more people in Teams.

**Guidelines**

Use "video call" or "audio call" when differentiation is needed.
