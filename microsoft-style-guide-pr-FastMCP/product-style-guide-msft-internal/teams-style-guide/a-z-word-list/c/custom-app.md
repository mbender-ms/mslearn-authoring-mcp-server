# custom app

An app built by an individual user that may or may not be approved by the tenant admin.

A custom app can be sideloaded (used or tested in an individual’s client) or submitted to the tenant’s IT for approval and inclusion in the tenant app catalog.

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: custom app
- When referring to the link in the bottom-left corner of Apps (when this setting is enabled by IT admin) use *upload a custom app*.
