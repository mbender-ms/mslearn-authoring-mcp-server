# channel

A virtual workspace for a team or community. A team has a collection of channels, each dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project.

Channels are where work (conversations, file sharing, channel meetings, etc.) is done.

They can be standard (everyone on the team has access), private (specific people on the team have access), or shared (people or teams in or outside your org can have access).

For communities, all channels are considered standard and do not have the capability to be made private or shared.
