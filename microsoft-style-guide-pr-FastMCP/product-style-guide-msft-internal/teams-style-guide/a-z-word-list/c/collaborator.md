# collaborator

Do not use.  

A person who works with others jointly on a project.

**Guidelines**  

- Instead, say team members, colleagues, people working on the project, etc.  
- It’s OK to use collaborate/collaborating/collaboration where appropriate, but be sure to vary language—especially in help content—and also say people, work together, etc. to avoid repeating collaborate over and over.
