# card

Do not use.  

A UI element that is in the shape of a card, like a contact card or task on a task board.  

**Guidelines**  

- Instead of *card*, use more descriptive end-user terms like contact card, task, or profile card.  
- Avoid terms like adaptive card, hero card, or connector card unless writing for a technical audience.
