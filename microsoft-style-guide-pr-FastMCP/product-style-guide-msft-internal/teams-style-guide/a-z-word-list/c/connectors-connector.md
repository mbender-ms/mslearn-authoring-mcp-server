# Connectors, connector

Connectors (title-case) is the channel menu option that lets you set up or configure connectors.  

The app capability, connector (lowercase) lets you set up app notifications to be sent as posts in a channel, based upon a triggered event (for example, when a new Trello ticket is created). 

**Guidelines**  
- Connectors: title-case  
- connector: lowercase  
- Say add a *connector*, not *install*.  
- Because the term is jargon, in long-form content, explain the concept of setting up notifications in a channel, then introduce the term *connector* as needed.
