# streaming mode/experience/attendee

Do not use.

Low-latency video streaming thatâ€™s optimized for large events. When an event is streaming, attendees have limited interaction and some apps and features are disabled by default.

**Guidelines**

Instead, reference the type of event or attendee experience: town hall, large event, attendees will join this event with their mics and cameras turned off by default.
