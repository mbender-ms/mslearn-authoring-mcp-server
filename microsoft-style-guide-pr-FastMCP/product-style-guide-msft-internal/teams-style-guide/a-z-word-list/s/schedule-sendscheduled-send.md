# schedule send/scheduled send

Do not use.  

This term is often used internally and refers to the feature that allows you to schedule chat messages to be sent at a later date/time by right-clicking the Send button.  

The feature itself is not named—it’s discussed in strings and help docs using descriptive language around the concepts of delivering messages at a certain time or scheduling messages to be sent at a certain time.  

The call-to-action label is descriptive: "Send at scheduled time."
