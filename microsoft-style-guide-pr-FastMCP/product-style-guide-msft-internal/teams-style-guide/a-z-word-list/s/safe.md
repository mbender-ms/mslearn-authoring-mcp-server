# safe

Do not use. *Safe* is no longer used in Microsoft Teams (free) and has been deprecated.

In Teams for Life, it was a feature that lets users store confidential information such as passwords and access codes.

**Notes**:

A personal safe is private and not shared with other users.  
A group safe is shared among participants in a group chat.
