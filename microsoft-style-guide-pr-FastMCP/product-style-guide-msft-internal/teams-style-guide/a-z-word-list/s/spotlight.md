# spotlight

The feature that enables meeting organizers or presenters to effectively pin someone’s video for everyone in the meeting. 

Up to seven people’s video streams can be spotlighted at once.

**Guidelines**

Use as a verb not as a noun. 

**Examples**: 
- "Spotlight me" and not "Put me in the spotlight."
- "You’re spotlighted" instead of "You’re in the spotlight."
