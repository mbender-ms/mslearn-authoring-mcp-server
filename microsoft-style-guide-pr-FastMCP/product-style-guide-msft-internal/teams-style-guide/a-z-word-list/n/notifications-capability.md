# notifications capability

The app capability that allows for data or content to be automatically posted by an app in a channel in Teams.  

**Guidelines**  
- *Notifications* is used on the app detail page. *Connectors* is used as the command in channel menu options.  
- In support content, itâ€™s best to explain the concept as setting up app notifications in a Teams channel and then introduce the term *Connectors*.
