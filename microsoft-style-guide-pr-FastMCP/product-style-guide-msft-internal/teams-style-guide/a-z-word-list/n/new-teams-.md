# new Teams 

The name of the new version of Teams (T2.1, internally) that shipped in 2023 is the same as the old version: Microsoft Teams (work or school). 

Because users can switch between the old and new Teams, we sometimes have to distinguish between the two versions in the UI. 

**Guidelines**

- When referring to the newer version of Teams, say, "the new Teams" or "the new version of Teams," never "the New Teams or New Teams," as the capital N indicates "New" is part of the product name, when it’s just a clarifying adjective. 
- The only exception to this is the toggle switcher at the top of the app labeled "New Teams" because it’s a short label that takes on sentence casing.  
- Conversely, when referring to the original version of Teams (T1, internally), use *the* *classic* *Teams* or *the classic version of Teams.*
