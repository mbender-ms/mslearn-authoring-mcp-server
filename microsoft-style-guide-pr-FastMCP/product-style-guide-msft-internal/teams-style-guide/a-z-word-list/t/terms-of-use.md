# terms of use

The link text to use when linking to a third-party appâ€™s privacy guidelines.

For example: "By using Jira Cloud, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of use."

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: terms of use
- Do not use terms of service, terms, or any other variations you might find on a third-party landing page.
- In a standalone link, capitalize the T in *Terms.* For example: "Privacy policy | Terms of use."
