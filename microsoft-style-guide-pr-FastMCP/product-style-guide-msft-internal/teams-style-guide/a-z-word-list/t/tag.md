# tag

An attribute you assign to people. 

By @mentioning the tag, you notify the group of people assigned to that tag all at once rather than having to @mention them individually. 

**Guidelines**

- Don't use tag when referencing people. We donâ€™t tag people.  
- We apply or assign tags to people. Say "someone was @mentioned," not "someone was tagged."
