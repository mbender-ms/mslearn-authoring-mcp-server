# tab

The app capability that lets you add a web-based app experience as a tab in a chat, channel, or meeting surface.

**Guidelines**

- Don’t replace the word *app* with *tab.* Instead, say "More apps," or "find an app with tab capability."
- Don’t say "install a tab" or "pin a tab." Instead, say "add a tab" or "turn an app or a file into a tab."
