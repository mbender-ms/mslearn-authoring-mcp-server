# Teams

The shortened product name. Say *Teams* in UX copy for the most part.

Also, the app in the app bar on the left side of Teams that opens the teams and channels list.

Itâ€™s represented by a team (3 people) icon.

**Guidelines**

Try to be specific to avoid confusing the Teams app with the product name.

**Examples**: 
- Go to Teams on the left side of the app.
- Go to Teams and look in your teams and channels list.
