# title bar

Do not use. For a technical audience only. 

The bar at the top of the app that contains the command box, profile picture, and back/forward navigation buttons. 

**Guidelines**

For end users, say instead "at the top of Teams," or when applicable, refer to a specific element in the title bar.
