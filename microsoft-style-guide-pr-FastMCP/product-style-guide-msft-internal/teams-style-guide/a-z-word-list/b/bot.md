# bot

The app capability that lets an app respond to questions, commands, or events/triggers in chat.

**Guidelines**

Use first-person voice when writing copy sent by a bot. It should have the feel of a person-to-person conversation. First-person also makes it clear that the communication is coming from the botâ€”not an actual person. This helps build trust and avoids AI and ethical issues.
