# banner

Do not use *banner* when referring to a system message that appears at the top of Teams. However, *banner* is a Windows term for desktop notifications and is OK to use for toasts.  

**Guidelines**  

- Do not use *banner* to refer to the system alerts at the top of Teams.  
- Instead, use *desktop notification* (*banner* is being phased out) for toasts.
