# Loop components

The name of the first-party Teams app derived from the Loop product used within chat and channel messages.  
  
The use of the shorter Loop when referring to the app name is sanctioned in two cases where space is limited: in the mobile app tray and in the message extension flyout. Otherwise, it's *Loop components*.

**Note**: *components* is plural.
