# list

In the Lists app, it is a set of items you want to keep track of and info related to those items.  

**Examples**: patients in a hospital ward and machine parts in a warehouse.  

In the Tasks app, it is a set of personal tasks. The term comes from the To Do app, which is for personal tasks. To Do lists are displayed in the personal Tasks app as well as in To Do.
