# event

A calendar event.

**Guidelines**

**Microsoft Teams (free)**  

- All mentions: event  
- **Example**: Create new event.  

**Teams for Work and Teams (free)**  

- All mentions: meeting  
- **Note**: In Teams for Work, there are some legacy uses of *event* resulting from aligning with Outlook on the web. Evaluate and change to *meeting* where it makes sense. Used to refer generally to town halls, webinars, and multi-session meeting templates, for example, “Invite attendees to this event” or “Your event is published.”
