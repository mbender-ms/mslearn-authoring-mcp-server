# More options

The overflow menu represented by three horizontal dots (three vertical dots on Android) that appears in various places in Teams.  

For accessibility, be contextual in the standard tooltip and call out the category of items in the menu. For example, *More message options, More added apps, More channel options.*  

**Guidelines**  

- **Examples**: Go to More message options. Select More added options. More channel options.  
- Donâ€™t say "overflow menu."
