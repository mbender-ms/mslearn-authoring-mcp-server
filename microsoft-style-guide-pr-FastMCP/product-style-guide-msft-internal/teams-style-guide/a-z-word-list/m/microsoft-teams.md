# Microsoft Teams

The full product name.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Microsoft Teams  
  You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  
- Subsequent mention: Teams  
- In most cases, the first mention is when the app is started or in the website chrome.  
- Also use the full product name on first mention in longform content or anywhere outside the product where showing up in search queries matters.
