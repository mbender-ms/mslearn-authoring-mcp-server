# me menu

Do not use.  

The menu that opens by clicking your profile picture. It contains entry points for changing your profile, seeing and switching between your accounts and orgs, and signing out.  

The tooltip for the control is *Account manager for [Name]* and is currently controlled by the Identity team across M365. Internally, the *me menu* is also known as the *me control*.  

**Guidelines**  

Use "select your profile picture" instead.
