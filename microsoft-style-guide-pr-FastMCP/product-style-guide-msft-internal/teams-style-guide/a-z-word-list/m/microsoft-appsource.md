# Microsoft AppSource

The public-facing listing of all Microsoft-approved apps for M365. 

Only apps submitted to and approved by AppSource are available to the public under Apps in Teams.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft AppsSource
- Subsequent mentions: AppsSource
- Not used in end-user copy in Teams UX. 
- For developer and admin audiences, say "submit to AppSource," not "upload to AppSource."
