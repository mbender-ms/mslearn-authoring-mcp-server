# install

To install a Teams desktop app to your computer, or a Teams mobile app to your device.

**Guidelines**

- Avoid using install with end users.  
- Instead, use "download" and then "sign in" (because installing is included in that process).  
- Use *add* when talking about adding a first-, second-, or third-party app in Teams.  
  - *Example*: Add Trello to Teams.  
- OK to use *install* with admins to install client apps.
