# invite

As a noun: the email sent to meeting attendees.  

As a verb: to send a request to someone to join a team.  

**Guidelines**  
- All mentions: invite  
- **Note**: Outlook uses *meeting request*, but in Teams, use *invite*.  
- Use only in cases where the recipient has to actually accept the invitation to join. In most cases, people are just added to teams.
