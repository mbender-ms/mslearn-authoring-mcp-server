# in-context store

Do not use.  

The internal name for the dialog from which you can add apps from the context youâ€™re in instead of from the main store in Teams. 

Sometimes this dialog is launched right from the app entry point as in the tab in-context store. Other times it is launched from the "Get more apps" button from the app flyout (message extension, meetings, bots).  

**Guidelines**  

- There should be little need to refer to this UI in support content or in the product.  
- If you ever need to, write around it as in this example: "Select Get more apps, then browse the selection of apps that appears."
