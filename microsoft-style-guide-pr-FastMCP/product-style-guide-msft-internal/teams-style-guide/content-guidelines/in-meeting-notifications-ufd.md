# In-meeting notifications (UFD)

**Note**: These guidelines are for everyone’s reference, writers and non-writers alike. But non-writers keep in mind that all UX copy need to be written and approved by a UX writer.  

## Crisp and clear 

Any notification that pops up in a meeting is appearing at an inopportune time and is therefore annoying, no matter how well-written it is.  

So, crisp and clear is the most important principle. A quick glance at it should be enough to get the gist.  


## Format/design

Most in-meeting notifications contain two parts: a title and a body.

**Note**: There are exceptions to this format. Some include a button
or two. Others are just a single line; no title, no buttons. More on
these exceptions later.

## Copy guidelines

### The title

The most important information goes in the title. A good question to
ask yourself: if the title is the only thing someone reads, is the
notification still useful? 

-   Don't put a period at the end of the title, unless it's more than
    one sentence. 
-   Keep it to one line. Unlike the description, it won't wrap to a
    second line. So if it's too long, it will truncate, which we very
    much want to avoid. Find a way to rewrite it so that key information
    fits.
-   Our usual copy guidelines always apply: use contractions, don't use
    overly technical language, be friendly and helpful, etc. 

Bad:

Better:

### The body

If there's more useful information or instruction to provide, that
goes in the body text. 

-   Use normal sentence punctuation, as in the examples above, even if
    the description only contains a single sentence.

-   Try to keep the body text to two lines maximum. The more words that
    are in this description, the less likely anyone is to read it. If
    you absolutely can't get the message across without wrapping to a
    third line, you'll need to get approval from the [UFD approval
    squad](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a0f7ec7b807354a0ba394b3d7a41e3000%40thread.skype/Feature%2520-%2520In-meeting%2520notifications%2520(UFD)?groupId=7cc2bcc3-969b-404a-9de4-6cd1d539eb11&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
    for an exception:
-   Sometimes you might want or need to include a link ("Learn more,"
    "Go to settings," etc.). Don't put a period at the end of linked
    text.

## Exceptions

### A one-liner

Sometimes you really don't need the title/description format; one line
is enough to provide all the pertinent information.

**Punctuation note**: if the one line is a complete sentence, put a
period at the end of it. If it's not a complete sentence, don't. 

### Buttons

Your UFD may include one or two buttons:

**Note**: The description here isn't a sentence and thus doesn't need
a period at the end of it. But it still provides plenty of info:
between the title and the buttons, it's clear what's happening and
what action should be taken. 

### No copy at all

A notification might not need any UX copy at all.

Here, the icon is doing all the work. Daniela raised her hand; that's
all anyone needs to know. 

Would the version below be more informative?

Not really. 

If it doesn't need to be said, don't say it.
