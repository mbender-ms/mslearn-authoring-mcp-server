# Coachmarks Guidelines

Coachmarks are used to draw a person’s attention to parts of the UI and increase engagement with those elements. Coachmarks can be standalone or sequential. Sequential coachmarks (aka teaching bubbles) should be used sparingly to walk through complex multistep interactions that do not exceed three steps.

## Standard desktop coachmarks

**Do:**

-   Sentence case headings (capitalize only the first word and any
    proper nouns), limit to 25 characters (including spaces), and keep
    them concise to one line of text. 
-   Keep body copy succinct and written in complete sentences with all
    punctuation included.
-   Use UI terms that match the Teams UI and are always bold and often
    sentence case.
-   Use generic verbs that work with any input method to describe
    interactions with the UI (e.g., Select, Go to, Choose, Open, Close).

**Don\'t:**

-   Add end periods to headers or list items.
-   Use Learn more links unless deep understanding is needed. When used,
    it's sentence case, points to support article, and should always be
    separated from the body copy.

**Best practice:**

-   Use a bold greater-than symbol "\>" when there's a clear and obvious
    path through the UI and the selection method is the same for each
    step (e.g., Settings and more \Keyboard shortcuts).



## Bulleted coachmarks

**Do:**

-   Aim to convey a single idea or feature per bullet and keep to one
    sentence. This helps users to quickly scan the coachmark which is
    difficult if the coachmark is loaded with text.

**Don\'t:**

-   Add end periods to headers or list items.
-   Use more than three bullet points per coachmark. Any information
    that isn't consider vital for the user can go inside of the learn
    more.

**Best practice:**

-   The Learn more button in bulleted coachmarks should take the user to
    the associated help article. 'What's new' is a specific use case
    where it always takes the user to the What's new release page which
    may contain additional links to related support articles.


## Modal coachmarks

**Do:**

-   Sentence case headings (capitalize only the first word and any
    proper nouns) and keep them concise. 
-   Lead with why the feature is useful rather than describe what it is.
    What does it make possible? Keep it within 120 characters (including
    spaces). 
-   Make the tone encouraging.
-   Keep CTA buttons and labels concise. Usually one or two words is
    best.

**Don\'t:**

-   Use Learn more links unless deep understanding is needed. When used,
    it's sentence case, points to support article, and should always be
    separated from the body copy.

**Best practice:**

-   Use UI terms that match the UI and are always bold and often
    sentence case.
-   Use generic verbs that work with any input method to describe
    interactions with the UI (e.g., Select, Go to, Choose, Open, Close).
-   Body copy should be succinct and written in complete sentences with
    all punctuation included.
-   Use a bold greater-than symbol "\" when there's a clear and obvious
    path through the UI and the selection method is the same for each
    step (e.g., Settings and more \Keyboard shortcuts).


## Teaching bubbles

A teaching bubble brings attention to a new or important feature, with
the goal of increasing engagement with the feature. A teaching bubble
typically follows a coachmark. Use teaching bubbles sparingly. Consider
how frequently people will see it, and how many they'll see across their
entire experience.

![A screenshot of a computer.](/product-style-guide-msft-internal/media/teams/coachmark_6.png)

**Do:**

-   Use to convey one new idea at a time---and only show one teaching
    bubble at a time. 
-   Use in sequence to walk people through complex, multistep
    interactions only. 
-   Use "x of y" text to indicate progress through the sequence. For
    example, the first teaching bubble in a sequence might be "1 of 3".
-   Always place the primary button on the left, the
    secondary button just to the right of it.
-   If including a header, limit to 25 characters (including spaces) to
    draw people in and get them interested. Limit to one line of text,
    and use sentence casing (capitalize only the first word and any
    proper nouns) with no punctuation.
-   Limit action button labels to 15 characters (including spaces).
    Provide people with an explicit action to dismiss the teaching
    bubble, such as "Got it". Include a secondary button to give people
    the option to take action, such as "Show me" or "Edit settings".
    When two buttons are needed, make the call-to-action button the
    primary button and the dismissal button (such as "No thanks") the
    secondary button. Use sentence casing (capitalize only the first
    word and any proper nouns) with no punctuation. On a sequenced
    teaching bubble, use \"Next\" for the action button label and \"Got
    it\" for the final sequenced teaching bubble action button with text
    that closes the experience.

**Don\'t:**

-   Add end period on header or list items.
-   Refer directly to the interface (Channels, not Channels app or
    Channels section).
-   Use Learn more links here as it takes the user out of their flow and
    may result in drop offs. Similarly, avoid adding CTAs in the middle
    of a sequential coachmark if it takes the user away from the
    coachmark.
-   Design more than 3 sequenced teaching bubbles for a single
    experience.

**Best practice:**

-   UI terms should match the UI and are always bold and often sentence
    case.
-   Less is more. People have short attention spans, so shorter
    walkthrough sequences will almost always do a better job of keeping
    someone's interest than one that is longer and more in-depth. 


## Standard desktop tooltip

**Do:**

-   Tooltips are most beneficial when they provide extra context to UI
    elements that aren't labeled.
-   It is best practice when wording tooltips to echo or draw from
    wording on the next surface.

**Don\'t:**

-   No end periods in tooltips.
-   Do not use links inside tooltips. Tooltips can't receive focus and
    therefore screen readers will never be able to access the link.

**Best practice:**

-   Keep tooltips lightweight and not overloaded with content. 80
    characters is usually the character limit for most desktop tooltips.
