# What's New (editiorial series)

What's New is an editorial series published on a monthly cadence, spanning in-app and web surfaces.

The audience is Teams end users (enterprise and consumers), which are largely non-technical (for example, not IT admin or dev.)

The purpose of What's New is to: 
1. Reinforce the subscription value by creating awareness of new features, fixes, and previews
2. Generate excitement around high-impact features
3. Drive the adoption and usage of the features and fixes 

The tone is celebratory, informative, and skimmable. Just the right amount of detail on each surface. Sometimes our titles are more direct when explaining a convoluted feature.

## Editorial Strategy

**Big News:** High requested, game-changing, or hero features (i.e., with marketing push behind them). Example: Calls app. Frequency of use: 5 percent. Purpose: excitement

**Features:** Everyday improvements that demonstrate ongoing subscription value, but don’t qualify as ‘big news’. Things that were big gaps compared to competitors. Example: Leave a group chat. Frequency of use: 93 percent. Purpose: Teams value, usage

**Fixes:** Bugs we’ve fixed if they caused big DSAT. Use only when the problem has attracted significant attention or the fix results in changes to user experience. Example: Status indicator out of sync with Me space – Fixed. Frequency of use: 2 percent. Purpose: Teams value

**Not worthy of What's New:** Small bug fixes that deter from celebratory tone; FRE features.

## Structure of What’s New on SMC

- Short bolded headline with playful hook, punchy and scannable
- 1-2 sentences of sub-head copy with description of feature (answers why should I care about this) and brief steps to enable it, if applicable
- Link: "To learn more, see [help article title]."

### The fine print

- Sub-head copy: Reasons to expand beyond 1-2 sentences is if we don't have a help article yet and we need to include the procedurals.
- Links: If we must link to learn/docs article (admin), mainly for devices, say "For admins looking for more information, see [article title]." In big moments, we can also link out to a blog post.
- Buttons are added to in-product surfaces: short 3-word CTAs, drive feature usage (“Get it now,” “Try it out,” “Watch short videos”).

## Content Example

### This:

**Leave a group chat**  
You’re now able to leave a group chat once you’re finished participating in the conversation. As soon as you leave a chat, everyone else will get a note letting them know that you’ve left. 

### Not this:

**Leave a group chat:** Users are now capable of leaving chats including more than two people by opening the overflow menu at the top of their chat and selecting “Leave”. All remaining chat members will be alerted that a member has left, and leaving a group chat will not remove it from the chat list.

## In-App and Web Surfaces

**Web (SMC)**, sometimes called "Release Notes"
