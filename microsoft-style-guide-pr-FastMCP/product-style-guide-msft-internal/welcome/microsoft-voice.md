# Microsoft voice

**Our mantra: Be bold. Be clear. Be brief.** Our customers don’t need more content. They need content that does more. So today, we tell them our stories in ways that rely on bigger ideas and fewer words—in a voice that’s boldly simple and daringly human.

**Voice principles** Microsoft’s unique, distinctive voice is always:

- Crisp and clear
- Warm and relaxed
- Ready to lend a hand

For customers, our voice helps make Microsoft’s vision real and accessible—irresistible even. And for those of us working here, our voice becomes the shared language of the products and experiences we create. Our voice brings it all together!

**Writing is design** We use design to figure out all sorts of things: what a product does, how it works, and what it says. Good writing is good design. And at its best, great design feels like a conversation.

**Style tips** A few key elements of writing Microsoft’s voice:

- **Get to the point fast.** Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don’t get in the way.
- **Talk like a person.** Choose optimistic, conversational language. Use short everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization. Shun jargon and acronyms. And never miss an opportunity to find a better word.
- **Simpler is better.** Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Step it out. Layer. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune every excess word.
