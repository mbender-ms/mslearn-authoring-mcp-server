# Write to be understood worldwide

The UI, websites, and all supporting material must make sense to a worldwide audience, even to those who don’t speak English fluently.

The first step in making your writing understandable is to globalize it—that is, to write content that’s easy to read and translate. The following tips will help you get started in writing for a worldwide audience.

- Avoid long, complex sentences. Break them up into shorter sentences that are easier to read and comprehend.

- Use lists and tables instead of complicated sentences and paragraphs.

- Use standard English grammar. In particular, avoid incomplete sentences.

- Include words that native English speakers often omit, such as *that* and *the*.

- Use commas to set off introductory phrases in a sentence.

  **Example**  
  With Virtual Machines, you have full control over your application environment and can migrate existing applications to Azure.

- Use language that’s likely to be understood by English speakers worldwide. Avoid idioms and slang. If you’re not sure whether a term is considered “standard English,” consult [the Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). If a word or phrase is listed with the meaning that you intend, it’s standard English and likely to be understood by non-native English speakers.

- Keep adjectives and adverbs near to the words that they modify. You can accidentally change the meaning of your message by placing them too far away from the words that they belong with.
