# Create global design + images

To globalize your design and images, follow these simple guidelines. If you’re not sure whether your images will work worldwide, consult the [Global Readiness](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness) website.

| **Guideline** | **More information** |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Choose colors carefully.** | Many colors have religious or political significance, such as those that are found on flags or that are symbolically linked to holidays. Neutral colors are usually all right. |
| **Choose simple or generic images that are appropriate worldwide.** | Soccer players and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, international highway signs, and historic artifacts such as the Egyptian pyramids are examples of worldwide images. Don’t use hand signs. Nearly every hand sign is offensive somewhere. Don’t use imagery based on English idioms, such as using a line of cars next to a jar of jam to indicate a traffic jam. |
| **If your content is going to be localized, avoid including text in graphics.** | Some users use automatic translation software to read English content. This software doesn’t translate text in graphics. Use captions, or provide an explanation in the main text. Create descriptive alt text for each image, especially for button images. Users who don’t understand the image can rely on alt text for an explanation. If you use imagery to label buttons, include text that describes the function of the button. |
| **Ensure that you’re legally permitted to distribute the imagery worldwide.** | Make sure that the rights you’ve negotiated permit worldwide distribution. Check the expiration dates of the license, and ensure that you’ll be able to remove the image before the license expires. Verify that copyright statements will protect the image anywhere that it may be seen. |
