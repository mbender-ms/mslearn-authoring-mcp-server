# Audience insights and keywords

How we talk empowers our audience in inspiring and relevant ways.

## Audience insights by segment

**Personal and family**—We know they’re not just consumers, they’re people. Just like us, they have lives full of work, family, and friends. We are there in support of their many activities, across all the different parts of their life, empowering them to make the most of each and every day.

**Small and medium business**—We know that to them, there’s nothing small about their business. It’s their life. So we’ll work to understand their unique challenges and do everything we can to help them achieve whatever it is they want.

**Education**—We know that helping students thrive is their biggest priority. And as education evolves and technology plays an ever-increasing role, school leaders and IT are often asked to do more with less. We’re by their side, working to help them achieve the best outcomes for their students in ways that work with their changing needs.

**Government**—We understand they aren’t driven by a paycheck, but by a purpose. For them, achieving is creating positive change for their constituents and communities. Beyond the latest tools, they need a partner who’ll ensure the sensitive information they’re working with is secure. We’ll work tirelessly to earn their trust so they can focus their energy on the most meaningful work.

**Enterprise**—We see them as our equal. A peer. In the new world of work, we know the challenges they face better than anyone. And, we’ll be alongside them during this journey, learning exactly what they want to achieve so we can give them exactly what they need to do it.

## Terminology

Word choice can help tailor our tone of voice to be more expressive for our consumer audience and more conservative for our enterprise audience. This table lists the keywords that are preferred for use in marketing to each of these audience segments. These terms may not work well in all languages, so please localize them when necessary.
