# Microsoft 365 admin voice principles

Every word in an interface is part of a “conversation” with the user. Whether it's voice, chat, or traditional UI, humans instinctively and unconsciously assign personality to digital experiences, even if the words they see or hear are just a few seconds long. So, it follows that we should intentionally create a coherent “voice” for the Microsoft 365 admin experience, rather than leave it up to chance.

Maintaining a coherent voice across Microsoft 365 admin experiences is important to supporting our brand identity and to providing a consistent, trustworthy experience for our customers.

## Our voice reflects the Microsoft voice: Above all, simple and human

- Warm and relaxed
- Crisp and clear
- Ready to lend a hand

## Voice principles for the admin audience

Our mission is to create UX content experiences that empower admins with clear, coherent, and helpful information when and where they need it—to remove barriers and help them get their jobs done.

- **Use plain language.** No one has ever complained that text was too easy to understand. The words we use should be clear and accessible to all admins, from small business admins to enterprise IT pros. We avoid jargon so that our pages are scannable and easy to understand. Technical details are available but less prominent. [According to this Nielsen Norman Group study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/plain-language-experts/), even experts want information that is easy to understand.

- **Focus on the value to the customer.** Our content answers "What does this mean?" "Why should I care?" and "What can I do about it?" Avoid focusing on Microsoft feature names, technology, and how things work on the back end.

- **Be transparent.** We clearly explain the impact of the actions we recommend—how it’ll change the experience for their users, or the efficiency of their business—so admins can decide what's best for their organizations.

## Very small business (VSB) admin voice principles

- **Treat them like regular people.** They wear lots of hats—owner, employee, information worker, customer, and (mostly accidental) admin—so tell the whole story from the admin and end-user points of view. And use the language that you’d use with ordinary consumers when you can.

- **Provide practical info.** They’re busy running a business and don’t have time for chit-chat, so tell them what to do and why—how it’ll benefit or affect them. Be enthusiastic when good things happen, but keep the focus on practical, helpful information.

- **Simplify.** Provide one simple, clear, default path, optimized for them. Make advanced steps and details available, but optional and out of the way. (In recent User Voice feedback, 50 of 377 VSB customers mentioned that the admin center was too complex or had too many features.)

## These voice principles align with Fluent design principles

- Keep it simple
- Make it personal
- Think universal
