# Family content guidelines

Our customers trust us with the digital and physical safety of their loved ones. Throughout the entire product experience, it’s critical that we be consistent with language and design that supports rather than constrains, guides rather than restricts, and informs rather than lectures.

Microsoft Family products and features are designed to foster trust, communication and transparency between family members across devices, internet activity, and driving patterns. These guidelines provide:

- Clarity with words and phrases.
- Standards for UX flows.
- A reference for integrating family features into products, such as Microsoft Edge and Office.
- An onboarding guide to familiarize new team members with content design principles.

## Know your audience

### Family organizer  
Whether they're parents, guardians, grandparents, or older siblings, every organizer should have confidence that we can help keep their family safe. We should avoid negative connotations, such as any implication that family members are being micromanaged or controlled. It's also important to show how easy it is to implement our features to help manage their busy schedules. We understand that family organizers can come from a variety of backgrounds but share a common goal of protecting their loved ones.

Goal mindset: “I have peace of mind knowing the people I care about are safe.”

### Family member  
Modern families come in all shapes and sizes. Our family features and products embrace this reality, and our content design should as well. The term *family member* refers to anyone over the age of 13 who's responsible for creating and managing their own digital identity. This might include a spouse, a child, a dependent, or an elderly relative. We want this audience to feel supported and empowered rather than stifled or restricted.

Goal mindset: "My family trusts me and knows I’m safe without affecting or sacrificing my independence."

### Child  
According to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA), a child is anyone under the age of 13. For those 12 and younger, parents or guardians are responsible for creating and managing their digital identities. This is a vulnerable and impressionable group. We don’t want to be intimidating or condescending in our family features. It’s a brave new online world for these young minds, and it’s our responsibility to help family members.

Goal mindset: "Look at all this fun stuff I get to do!”

## Business impact

Microsoft empowers families to collaborate, connect, and do life together. Bottom line—engagement in our products. When they’ve set up family settings, there’s more incentive for them to use products and their features like Microsoft 365 Family, Rewards, and Microsoft Edge.

| **Feature** | **How to talk about it** | **Examples** | **Language to avoid or use carefully** |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|

Turning on the **Filter inappropriate websites** option will block other browsers. | **Filter content** Make sure your family member can access only age-appropriate content and games. <br/><br/>Content filters help make sure you see only apps, games, or websites that are OK for your age. | Restrictions <br/><br/>Restrict |
| Find your family | - Don’t say “location tracking.” It’s creepy. <br/>- “Stay up to date” <br/>- “Check in on” <br/>- “Share your location” <br/>- “Keep in touch” | Spot your child on a map when they’re out and about. | Tracking <br/><br/>Monitoring |

## Family-specific terminology

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|----------|---------------|
| Organizer or family organizer | Use to refer to family group administrators, typically adults, who access family member activity reports, set or adjust limits, and give or remove permissions. <br/><br/>When referencing a task that needs organizer approval, try to phrase without using the word *organizer.* For example, “Ask for more time” or “Ask for help to complete these next steps” are great ways to phrase these tasks. <br/><br/>“Ask an organizer” is the most inclusive. “Parent or guardian” can be used when referencing consent (for example, needing consent for tasks such as onboarding). |
| Family member | Use to refer to all members of a family group who aren't organizers. Family members can be any age. Family members under statutory age (12 and under) must receive organizer consent to create a Microsoft account or join a family group. <br/><br/>Only use the term “child” or “kids” if referencing direct text from Family Safety. For example, if a step-by-step guide includes clicking Manage my child’s profile info, “child” should remain in the text because the guide is quoting directly from the app. |
| Screen time terms | **Screen time** — The amount of time a family member spends actively engaged with their device. This is also the name of our feature and the term most familiar to organizers. <br/><br/>**Time limits**—Time limits are used to establish boundaries on length of time/time of day a family member can use their devices. Limits can be modified by day or kept the same throughout the week. <br/><br/>**One Schedule**—Set limits across all connected Family Safety devices (only Windows and Xbox). For example, a family member can use their devices collectively for four hours a day, choosing how they will divide that time across platforms. <br/><br/>**Schedule**—Schedule a time when a family member can use their device. For example, allow your family member to use their Xbox on weekdays from 4 to 5:30 PM. <br/><br/>**App limits**— Time limits set on a particular app or game. |
| Content filters terms | *Content filters can be applied only to web activity in the Microsoft Edge browser.* <br/><br/>**Filter inappropriate content**—Filters mature content and enables SafeSearch. Turning this on will block all other browsers. <br/><br/>**Always allow educational websites**—Always permit access to selection of educational websites curated by Microsoft <br/><br/>**Web and search activity**—Recent website/search term history <br/><br/>**Allowed sites**—Websites that are always allowed in Family Safety <br/><br/>**Visits**—Number of times a family member visited an allowed site <br/><br/>**Blocked sites**—Websites that can't be accessed (set up in Family Safety) <br/><br/>**Attempts**—Number of times a family member tried to visit a blocked site |

## Writing for children’s privacy

Under laws like COPPA and AADC, we can’t always show certain settings to users under statutory age. There are some settings like activity reporting that we have to be extra clear about to make sure it's comprehensible for our younger audiences. Our goal is to be clear about why things are changing, but not be paternalistic or talk down to younger users. For more information, refer to the [Children’s privacy content design guide](https://hits.microsoft.com/Collection/7002226) by Amy Keeney in HITS.

## Summary

- Don't use nudge techniques to lead children to make poor privacy decisions or to choose the option that provides more data.
- Use **pro-privacy** nudges where appropriate.
- Consider nudging to promote **health** and **wellbeing.**

## Examples 
Microsoft cares about your privacy. We collect some kinds of info only from people above a certain age. Because you’re younger, we turned off these privacy settings you can’t use yet:

- Optional diagnostic data

This change won’t make Office work any differently than before. When you’re older, we’ll let you know when you can change this setting.

You need to be older to change this setting.
