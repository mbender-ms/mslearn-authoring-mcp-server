# ERP, enterprise resource planning

**Guidelines**

It’s OK to use *ERP* on first mention without spelling out enterprise resource planning if the context is clear and you’re sure your audience knows what it stands for.  
Use it as a modifier, such as ERP platform.  
Don’t use *ERP* on its own to refer to enterprise resource planning software, systems, or platforms.  
Don't use *ERP* as a noun without *software*, *systems*, or *platforms*.

Don't use an article (a, an, the) before *ERP*.

**Our style**  
Go beyond traditional ERP software with a solution that builds continuity and resiliency into your business processes.  
Gain real-time insights into your supply chain with an ERP platform.

**Not our style**  
The ERP expands your customer's insights and strategies.
