# edit

To edit information or change a setting.

When to use *edit* in UI buttons or action link text:

- Always use *Edit* as the label for the pencil icon. Make sure there’s an ARIA label that says what the user is editing—for example, "Edit roles."
- For label or link text, use *Edit* or *Edit+object*.
  - Use *Edit+object* (for example, *Edit password*) for the link text if editing is the primary call to action on the page. This helps make the link more scannable without having to reference the heading it’s under.
  - If the link is a secondary action, and longer link text might be distracting, use just the verb as visible link text (for example, *Edit*), but provide *Edit+object* in the ARIA text.
- Best practices for which verb to use:
  - Use *edit* for UI where you can edit information, such as a username, description, or password.
  - Use *manage* in UI when *edit* is too specific because there are multiple tasks you can do, such as set up, update, reorder items, add, and remove, all in one place.
  - Use *change* in UI where the user can swap out one option for another option, such as change your default payment method or change your status.
  - Avoid *configure.* Substitute *set up, edit,* or *manage,* depending on the specific capability.
- To prevent repetition in your text, you can occasionally use alternatives to *edit, change,* and *manage.*
