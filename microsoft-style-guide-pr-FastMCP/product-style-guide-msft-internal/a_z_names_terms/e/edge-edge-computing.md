# edge, edge computing

Computing that shifts most data processing from a centralized system such as a public cloud to the edge of the network, closer to a device or system that requires data quickly. An example is an application that puts data processing in a sensor to quickly process reactions to alarms.

**Guidelines**

Use “at the edge”—not “on the edge”—in references to edge computing.  
Make sure it’s clear what *the edge* and *edge computing* mean unless you’re sure your audience is familiar with the terms.
