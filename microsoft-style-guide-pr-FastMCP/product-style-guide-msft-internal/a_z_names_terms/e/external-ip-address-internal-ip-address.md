# external IP address, internal IP address

External IP addresses (or public IP addresses) can be used on the internet and aren't part of the reserved address ranges seen in an internal IP address (also often called a private IP address). 

All these terms are common. On the first reference to the term *internal IP address,* add the parenthetical phrase *(often called a private IP).* On the first reference to *external IP address,* add *(also called a public IP).*
