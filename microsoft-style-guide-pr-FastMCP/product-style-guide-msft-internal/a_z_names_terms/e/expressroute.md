# ExpressRoute

Enables customers to create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure that's either on-premises or in a colocation environment.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: ExpressRoute
- Individual instance (built using this service): ExpressRoute connection
