# end of support

Refers to the date when Microsoft no longer provides automatic fixes, updates, or online technical assistance.  

In most cases, *end of support* and *end of service* are synonyms, but our preferred term is *end of support*. Never use *end of life* in reference to a Microsoft product.  

Hyphenate when used as a modifier, as in *end-of-support status*.  

Don't abbreviate to *EOS* except in the UI where space is very limited (as in a column label or tag). It should be spelled out elsewhere.
