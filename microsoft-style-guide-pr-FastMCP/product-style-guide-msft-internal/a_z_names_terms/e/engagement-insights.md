# engagement insights

As of October 2020, the app formerly known as Dynamics 365 Product Insights Preview is now *engagement insights.* Currently in preview, engagement insights is a feature of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. (The other is [audience insights](~\a_z_names_terms\a\audience-insights.md).)

## References in regular text

In regular text like marketing copy, documentation, and training material, try to use wording that focuses on the customer’s intent rather than the name *engagement insights.*

When it’s necessary to explain what engagement insights is, it’s OK to use wording like “engagement insights (preview) in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.”

Don’t use “Dynamics 365 Engagement Insights” or “Dynamics 365 engagement insights.” Never abbreviate the name.

## In the product

The engagement insights capability uses the Customer Insights app header.

In text within the product, including UI labels, try to use wording that emphasizes the user’s intent rather than the name of the capability—for example, “Start gathering insights” rather than “Get started with engagement insights.”

When you do refer to *engagement insights* by name in the product:

- Use lowercase *engagement insights* unless the name appears at the beginning of a text string, and then use *Engagement insights.*
- Add *(preview)* after *engagement insights,* lowercase and in parentheses:  
  engagement insights (preview)
