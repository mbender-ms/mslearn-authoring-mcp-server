# Exchange

Exchange is a service that provides business-class email and calendaring as a hosted service or one that can be run on a business’s servers.

**Guidelines**

*Exchange* can refer to either Exchange Server or Exchange Online. In a hybrid or mixed environment that has both Exchange Server and Exchange Online, always be specific and use the full names.

Otherwise, *Exchange* by itself is OK to use as a short form for either Exchange Server or Exchange Online, after the full name is used on the first reference.

You don’t need to include *Microsoft* in the app name, except on the first mention in third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isn’t present.
