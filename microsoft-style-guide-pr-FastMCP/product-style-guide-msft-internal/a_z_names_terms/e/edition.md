# edition

Don't refer to different offerings from the Digital Transformation Platform Group as editions. As of the Spring 2018 release, Microsoft is no longer offering separate Business and Enterprise editions of Dynamics 365. Instead, organizations can choose from different price points for each line of business application, based on the level of capability and capacity they need.
