# extended detection and response (XDR)

A type of security approach or solution that provides visibility and control over multiple entity types and workloads—devices, files, emails, identities, chats, network traffic, among others—to perform threat identification and remediation holistically across an organization.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: extended detection and response (XDR)
- Subsequent mentions: XDR 
- Spell out on first or most prominent use, unless part of a brand like *Defender Experts for XDR*. 

Don't confuse with *endpoint detection and response (EDR)*, which is used to refer to security solutions that focus on securing devices. 

In security portals, use *XDR* to refer to cross-workload detection and response capabilities, such as the Microsoft 365 Defender correlation rules. However, when a more specific capability name, such as *hunting* is available, use that capability name.
