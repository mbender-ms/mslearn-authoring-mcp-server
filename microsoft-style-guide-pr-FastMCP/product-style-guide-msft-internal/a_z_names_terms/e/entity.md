# entity

The meaning of the term _entity_ varies in different products. Use the term appropriately in your context.

**Azure Table Storage**

In Azure Table Storage, a table represents a collection of entities. Entities are similar to rows. An entity has a partition, a primary key, and a set of properties.

**Microsoft Dataverse and Dataverse for Teams**

Beginning October 30, 2020, donâ€™t use _entity_ or _entities_ in reference to Dataverse. In Dataverse, the term _entity_ was replaced with _table_.

**See** [table](~\a_z_names_terms\t\table.md) and [record](~\a_z_names_terms\r\record.md)
