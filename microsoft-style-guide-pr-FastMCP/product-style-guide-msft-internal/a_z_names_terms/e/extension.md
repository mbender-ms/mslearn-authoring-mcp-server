# extension

An extension is a type of program or code that's meant to expand on the functionalities of another program. It provides expanded options and can enhance the abilities of the base program.  

It’s not synonymous with *plug-in* or *add-ons*.  

Don’t confuse with [file name extension](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/e/extension-file-name-extension).  

**Example**  

[Test Manager extension](~\a_z_names_terms\t\test-manager-extension.md)  
internet browser extension  

**Also see** [plug-in](~\a_z_names_terms\p\plug-in-plugin.md), [add-in](~\a_z_names_terms\a\add-in.md), [add-on](~\a_z_names_terms\a\add-on.md)
