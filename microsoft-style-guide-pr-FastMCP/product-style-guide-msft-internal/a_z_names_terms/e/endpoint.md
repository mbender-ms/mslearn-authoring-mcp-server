# endpoint

A device or virtual machine that can connect to a network. Examples include IoT devices, mobile devices, desktops, servers, and so on.

One word.

It's OK to use *endpoint* in content for device management specialists if you're describing tasks that involve multiple types of endpoints, such as Android devices, PCs, and Macs. But when you're describing a task that involves a single type of device, refer to it specifically.
