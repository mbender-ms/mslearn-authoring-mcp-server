# email address

A string that identifies a user so that the user can receive internet email. An email address on the internet typically consists of an account name followed by the at sign (@) and a domain name.

- When describing the functionality for accounts, use familiar words like *email address* and *Microsoft account.*
- Avoid words like *sign-in name* and *alias.*

**Examples**  
You can create a Microsoft account with any email address that you already have.  
You can add other email addresses to your Microsoft account, too. Then, you can sign in and send and receive messages from any of those email addresses from within Outlook.com.
