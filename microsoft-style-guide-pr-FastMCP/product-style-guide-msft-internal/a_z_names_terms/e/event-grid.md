# Event Grid

Microsoft Azure Event Grid is a fully managed, intelligent, event-routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using a publish-subscribe model.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Event Grid

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Event Grid

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
