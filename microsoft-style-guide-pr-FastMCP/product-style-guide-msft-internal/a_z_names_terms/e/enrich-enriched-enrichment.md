# enrich, enriched, enrichment

OK to use all forms in UI labels and explanations. *Enriched* is used as an adjective to describe the result of a data-enrichment process. 

*Enrich* in the sense of augmenting data is a general business term; it isn't specific to AI. Because the term *enrich* is heavily associated with data, don't use it in a general way to mean enhance, as in "enriching Dynamics 365 with deeper integrations with Microsoft Outlook, Teams, and LinkedIn."

**Examples**

[From Dynamics 365 Customer Insights]:  
Use proprietary data from Microsoft Graph to enrich your customer data with brand and interest affinities.
