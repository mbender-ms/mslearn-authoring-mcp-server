# Electronic Invoicing for Dynamics 365

The Electronic Invoicing Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a hyperscalable, multitenant service that enables configurable processing of electronic invoice documents and configurable document exchange.

Electronic Invoicing is an add-in for several Dynamics 365 apps, including Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, and Project Operations. In the future, it will work with additional Dynamics 365 apps and third-party apps via Dataverse. So the name includes just “for Dynamics 365”—it doesn’t reference a specific app.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Electronic Invoicing Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Electronic Invoicing for Dynamics 365, Electronic Invoicing

Capitalize *Electronic Invoicing* only in references to the product. In general references, use *electronic invoicing* and *electronic invoice,* lowercase.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
