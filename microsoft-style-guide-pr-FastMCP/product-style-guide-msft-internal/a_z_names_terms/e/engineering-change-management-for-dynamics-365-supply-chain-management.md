# Engineering Change Management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

**Guidelines**

First mention: Engineering Change Management Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Engineering Change Management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Engineering Change Management

Capitalize *Engineering Change Management* only in references to the add-in. In general references, use *engineering change management,* lowercase.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
