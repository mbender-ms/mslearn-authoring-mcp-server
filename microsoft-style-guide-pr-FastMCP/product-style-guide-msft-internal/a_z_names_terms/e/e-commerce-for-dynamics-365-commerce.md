# E-Commerce for Dynamics 365 Commerce

**Guidelines**

First mention: E-Commerce Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

- You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: E-Commerce for Dynamics 365 Commerce, E-Commerce

- Don’t refer to *E-Commerce* as an app.
- Always hyphenate *E-Commerce.*

Note the capitalization of the add-in name. (This is different from how Microsoft capitalizes e-commerce in general references. See the [e-commerce](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/e/e-commerce) article in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide* for more information.) Capitalize *E-Commerce* only in references to the add-in. In general references, use *e-commerce,* lowercase.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
