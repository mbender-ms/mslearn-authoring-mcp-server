# enlightened, unenlightened

Don’t use. Instead, use clear and simple wording to explain the concepts.

**Our style**  

Many apps treat all data as corporate and encrypt everything. But apps that identify protection policies can differentiate between corporate and personal data and use your policies to determine which to protect.
