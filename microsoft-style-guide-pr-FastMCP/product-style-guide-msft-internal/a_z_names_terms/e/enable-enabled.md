# enable, enabled

Don't use to describe activating a setting or feature. Replace with *turn on, make available, set up, allow,* or another more specific verb.

When you're describing what a product or feature makes possible for customers, avoid *enable* by rewriting to focus directly on what you can do with that feature. We want customers to feel empowered. Describing what a feature *enables, allows,* or *lets* customers do subordinates the customer.

**Exceptions**

- In marketing aimed at business decision makers, it's OK to use *enable* about capabilities that the organization can provide for their users.
- When an admin is empowering their users to install an app, turn a setting on, or set something up, it's OK to use *enable/disable* for that overarching admin control (to avoid phrases like "turn on the ability to turn on"). But write around this if you can reasonably do so.
- For apps, use *enable* to refer to making them available to be installed or used.
