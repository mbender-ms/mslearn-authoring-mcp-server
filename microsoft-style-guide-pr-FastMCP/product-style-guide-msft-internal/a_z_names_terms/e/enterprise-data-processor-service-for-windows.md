# Enterprise Data Processor Service for Windows

Enterprise Data Processor Service for Windows is a new service offering that focuses on our commitment in terms of how Windows diagnostic data is handled and on our continuing enhancements of data privacy for Windows. Enterprise Data Processor Service for Windows enables enterprise customers to become the controller (GDPR) for Windows diagnostic data collected from devices enrolled under this service. With this service, data will be governed by Microsoftâ€™s Online Services Terms, and stored in a high-compliance boundary, separate from Windows diagnostic data that Microsoft collects as controller.
