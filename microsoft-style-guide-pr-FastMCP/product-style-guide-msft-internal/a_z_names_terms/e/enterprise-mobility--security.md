# Enterprise Mobility + Security

Enterprise Mobility + Security provides comprehensive solutions, intuitive management, and identity-driven security that helps users stay productive and secure on any device.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Enterprise Mobility + Security
- Use the plus sign (+) in the name, not an ampersand (&).
- Don’t use *Enterprise Mobility Suite.* Use *Enterprise Mobility + Security* instead.
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
