# edition (Microsoft 365)

Use to refer to the different Windows SKUs in a release. For example, Windows 11 Home is one edition, and Windows 11 Pro is another.

**Note:** The term *SKU* is often used within Microsoft to refer to a specific edition of a specific version of a product. But never use the word *SKU* in customer-facing content.

Use *version* only to refer to different operating systems, such as Windows 10 and Windows 11.

**Examples**
