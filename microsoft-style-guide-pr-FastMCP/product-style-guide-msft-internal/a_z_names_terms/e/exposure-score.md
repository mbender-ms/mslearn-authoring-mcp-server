# exposure score

A number calculated to let the customer know how vulnerable devices in their organization are. The higher the number, the higher the exposure level (and thus more vulnerable).​

In narrative text, be specific about which entities are exposed and what the number indicates (high, medium, or low exposure).​

**Example**  
The exposure level of [entity name] is high due to [issue].
