# EX, employee experience

Employee experience (EX) describes the overall opinions employees have about their interactions with other employees and their place of work.  
**Guidelines**

- When writing customer-facing material, introduce the *EX* acronym by spelling out *employee experience* on the first mention, with the acronym in parentheses. It is OK to use the acronym on subsequent mentions in the same space.  
- For internal documents or for those familiar with the term *EX*, it is OK to use it without spelling it out first.  
- *Employee experience* is sentence-case.
