# Export Management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management​

Export Management is an add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management​ that allows companies to model and enforce export regulations throughout the sales process.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Export Management Add-In for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Export Management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Export Management

Capitalize Export Management only in references to the add-in. In general references, use *export management*, lowercase. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for 365.

Don’t refer to Export Management as an app.
