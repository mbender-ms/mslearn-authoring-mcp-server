# Backup

Azure Backup is a service that lets customers use standard backup tools to manage and protect a wide range of enterprise workloads, including Azure Virtual Machines, SQL and SAP databases, Azure file shares, and on-premises VMware machines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Backup

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Backup
