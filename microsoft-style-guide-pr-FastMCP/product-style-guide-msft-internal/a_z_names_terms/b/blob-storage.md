# Blob Storage

An Azure service that stores unstructured data in the cloud as objects/blobs. It is part of Azure Storage.  

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Blob Storage

The earlier name, *Blob service*, is still in some older reference content but should not be used in the majority of customer-facing content, especially new content.

Don’t say *Blob Storage service*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
