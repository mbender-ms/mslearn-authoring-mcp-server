# benchmark

A benchmark is a standard or point of reference against which things may be compared or assessed.

Use carefully. *Benchmark* is easily confused with *baseline,* even if they have technically distinct definitions. Use it only if appropriate for the audience and only when the meaning is clear.

In UX in particular, always modify the word *benchmark* to clarify the specific context for the benchmarkâ€”for example, use wording like *industry benchmark* or *regional benchmark.*
