# B2B direct connect

B2B direct connect is a new set of features for Azure Active Directory that enable frictionless user experiences for B2B partners outside the organization. This set of features can be turned on by an IT admin to allow users outside the organization to easily access apps and resources and collaborate with internal users (such as, by enabling the new Microsoft Teams Connect shared channels feature).
