# Business Central (on-premises)

Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises) is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps customers manage their business.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, and the context makes it clear that you're talking about the on-premises deployment, you can use the app name alone:

Business Central

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
