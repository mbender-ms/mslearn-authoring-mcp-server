# billing profile

A billing profile includes a payment method, contact info, and other invoice settings. When customers buy products based on the Microsoft Customer Agreement, they choose a billing profile to cover the purchase. A billing profile also has billing profile roles, which admins can assign to let different users edit the billing profile, use the billing profile to buy items, pay bills, or view the billing profile.

â€‹Lowercase *billing profile*. 

As customers move from legacy purchasing agreements (such as Microsoft Online Services Agreement or enterprise agreements) to the evergreen Microsoft Customer Agreement, they'll start encountering both *billing account* and *billing profile* terminology. The term *billing profile* will be less familiar to them, so focus on the payment method as the thing that's paying for the subscription.

**Example**  
**Visa *1234 pays for your subscription to Microsoft 365 Business Premium. Update your billing profile to use a different payment method.**
