# BI, business intelligence

It's OK to use *BI* on the first mention without spelling out *business intelligence* if the context is clear and you're sure your audience will know what you mean.

The most important thing is to be clear. In general, for reasons of clarity and voice, we prefer to spell out terms rather than use acronyms. So *BI* is OK in the name Power BI and content related to Power BI, but consider spelling it out in other contexts.

*BI* also means *behavior informatics* (an AI term). So in technical content about AI for makers and analysts, you might need to spell out *business intelligence* for clarity.
