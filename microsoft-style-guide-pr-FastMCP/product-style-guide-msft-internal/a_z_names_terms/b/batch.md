# Batch

A service for running large-scale parallel and batch compute jobs.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Batch

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Batch
