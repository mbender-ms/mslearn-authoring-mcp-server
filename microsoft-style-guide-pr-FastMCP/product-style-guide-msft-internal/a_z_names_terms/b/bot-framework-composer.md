# Bot Framework Composer

Bot Framework Composer, built on the Bot Framework SDK, is an open-source development environment for developers to author, test, provision, and manage conversational experiences.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Bot Framework Composer

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Bot Framework Composer, Composer

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
