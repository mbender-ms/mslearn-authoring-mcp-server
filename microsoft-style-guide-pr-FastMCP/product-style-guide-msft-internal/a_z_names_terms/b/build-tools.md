# build tools

A collection of code, templates, and similar tools that automate common configuration and deployment tasks.

Lowercase when you're using the term generically, but use title-style capitalization in the names of specific build tools, such as Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools.

Note that itâ€™s *tools,* plural.
