# Beta

Beta is the name of the Office release channel for early adopters and developers in which client builds are available to the subscriber early in the development cycle with the newest code, which is typically weekly or biweekly. In references to this release channel, *Beta* is capitalized.

*Beta* replaces *Insider* (sometimes referred to as *Insider Fast*) in the context of Office release channels.

Don't use *Beta Channel.*

Don't use *beta* in most other contextsâ€”instead, use *preview* to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for testing by customers. See [Product previews](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/new-products/product-previews) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.
