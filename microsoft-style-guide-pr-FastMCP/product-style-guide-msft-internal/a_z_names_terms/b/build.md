# build

A named set of software components that are produced, usually by compiling, from a discrete set of source versions. A *build* is a smaller release between major versions.

Avoid using *build* when you can use a friendlier release or version name instead. It's OK to use *build* if you need to refer to a specific build number.

**Example**  
If you're running build 14326.20404, you need to install this update.
