# bookmark

In Microsoft Search, a bookmark is an admin-defined or search editor–defined shortcut to websites, forms, reports, and so on, to help users find them. These search results are delivered to signed-in users​.

In third-party products, a bookmark is a user-defined shortcut to the most commonly used forms, reports, websites, and so on.

Don't use to mean a favorite (that is, a saved website) in Microsoft Edge.

**Example**  
Bookmarks help you promote the best possible results for your user's work-related queries. The more bookmarks you publish, the more value and benefit you add for users.​
