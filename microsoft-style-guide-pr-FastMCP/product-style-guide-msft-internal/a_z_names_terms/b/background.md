# background

The desktop background on a PC or the area that appears behind the tiles on the Start screen.

- Don't use *wallpaper, pattern, tattoo,* or any other substitute for *background*.
- It's OK to include *wallpaper* as a secondary term in parentheses in cases where we need to optimize for search. (*Wallpaper* is a more familiar term for many customers, and the term ranks high in searches.) Don't include it parenthetically after every instance of *background*.
- *Wallpaper* is the word form for both singular and plural uses. Don't add an *s,* as in *wallpapers*.
