# Business Applications ISV Connect Program

The Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect Program enables partners to work with Microsoft to help them increase their success in developing and selling line-of-business applications built on Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect Program

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Business Applications ISV Connect Program, Business Applications ISV Connect

- Include *the* in references to the Business Applications ISV Connect Program (except when it appears alone in a heading).
- Capitalize *Program* in references to the full program name, but lowercase *program* when it's used alone. The capitalization of "Program" is an exception to the general guideline. See [program](~\a_z_names_terms\p\program.md).
- Drop *Program* and just use *Business Applications ISV Connect* as the modifier—for example, "Business Applications ISV Connect requirements."
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
