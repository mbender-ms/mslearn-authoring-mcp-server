# billing account

For business, commercial, education, and government customers, billing accounts define their commerce relationship with Microsoft. The billing account includes info such as legal entity name and address, all signed agreements for purchasing with Microsoft, partners that the customer has delegated access to, company affiliates, and tax IDs.

Admins can assign billing account roles to users in their organization, which allows them to sign purchasing agreements, buy products, or edit billing account details.

Lowercase.

**Example**  
â€‹Make sure that for each billing account, the billing account owner role is assigned to more than one person.
