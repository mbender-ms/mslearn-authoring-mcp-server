# Billing Alert Service

Enables administrators to create customized billing alerts that help them monitor and manage billing activity for their Azure accounts.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Billing Alert Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Billing Alert Service

To avoid repeating the word *service*, don't use *Billing Alert Service service*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
