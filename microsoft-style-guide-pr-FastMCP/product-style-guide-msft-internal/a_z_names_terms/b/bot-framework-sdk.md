# Bot Framework SDK

The Bot Framework SDK, along with Azure Bot Service, provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage bots.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Bot Framework SDK
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Bot Framework SDK, the SDK
- Don't spell out *software development kit.*
- Always spell out the name; with the exception of *SDK,* don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
