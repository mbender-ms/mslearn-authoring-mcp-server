# baseline

A *baseline* is a minimum or starting point used for comparisons.

Replace with *benchmark* (the more general term for a basis of comparison) unless you're referring to a specific baseline. In that case, specify the type of baseline—for example, *security baseline.*

Avoid *baseline* as a UI label by itself. In UI, always use with a modifier—for example, *Security baseline, Performance baseline,* or *Devices baseline*—unless the context is clear.
