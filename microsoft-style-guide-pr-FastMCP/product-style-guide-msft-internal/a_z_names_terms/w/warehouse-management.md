# Warehouse Management

Warehouse Management is a mobile app within Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management that’s used to manage tasks in a warehouse.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Warehouse Management mobile app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Any of the following are acceptable if they’re clear in context:

- Warehouse Management mobile app in Supply Chain Management
- Warehouse Management in Supply Chain Management
- Warehouse Management mobile app
- Warehouse Management

Don’t use the previous name, *Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - Warehousing app.*

Be sure the context makes it clear whether you’re talking about the Warehouse Management mobile app or the warehouse management module, both of which are in Supply Chain Management. If necessary, use “mobile app” or “module” as descriptors to clarify.

Capitalize *Warehouse Management* only in references to the mobile app. In general references, use *warehouse management,* lowercase.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
