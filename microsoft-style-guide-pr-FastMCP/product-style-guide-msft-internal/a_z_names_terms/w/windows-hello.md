# Windows Hello

A Windows technology that lets people sign in to Windows using fingerprint, face, or iris recognition. This requires specific hardware, such as a fingerprint reader or a camera that supports the technology.

- Don't localize. The name is *Windows Hello* in all markets.
- It's OK to use just *Hello* after the first mention.
- Put a nonbreaking space between *Windows* and *Hello* so that the name doesn't wrap to a different line.â€¯  
- The enterprise version is *Windows Hello for Business* (note the capitalization). It's OK to use *Hello* or *Hello for Business* after the first mention.
