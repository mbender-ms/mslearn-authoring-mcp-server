# work or school account

This is a business account typically assigned by an individual's organization. Azure customers can sign up for a new subscription using either their work or school account or their Microsoft account.

- **A work or school account** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) provides access to cloud services such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, and Office 365. When a customer signs up as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent their organization. After this directory has been created, an admin can then create users and assign licenses to them based on which cloud service subscriptions they need access to, such as Azure.

- **A Microsoft account** (created by you for personal use) provides access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Office 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. A Microsoft account can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure.

**Guidelines**

For sign up/sign in, always specify which account type you mean: *work or school account* or *Microsoft account.*

It’s OK to use *your account* when there’s no ambiguity.

*Work or school account* is preferred. Use *work account* only if space constraints.

Don’t use *organizational account*.
