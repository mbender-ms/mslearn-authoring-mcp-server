# Windows 365

Windows 365 is a cloud subscription that enables customers to stream Windows 10 or Windows 11 from the cloud to any compatible device. When referring to the Windows 365 brand name or any of the individual Windows 365 editions or products, follow these guidelines.

- Never include *Microsoft*.
- Always include *Windows*; don't shorten to just *365*.
- Always spell out *Windows 365*. Don’t abbreviate the name or create acronyms, such as *W365*.
- Always use numerals for *365*; don’t spell out the number.
- Always include a space between *Windows* and *365*.
- In speech, the correct pronunciation in English is “Windows three sixty-five” or “Windows three six five," not “three hundred sixty-five.”
- Never separate *Windows* from *365*. They should always appear on the same line.

Windows 365 is available in two editions:

- **Windows 365 Business**—focusing on small and medium-size customers
- **Windows 365 Enterprise**—focusing on enterprise customers
