# Windows Server

This page lists brief guidelines for referring to the names of Windows Server editions.

For all the following names, always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Don’t precede *Windows Server* with *Microsoft.*

When you’re not referring to the entire platform and not referencing functionality that’s specific to an edition, use just *Windows Server 2022* or *Windows 2019.*

On subsequent mentions, after the full name has been introduced and when it’s clear which version and edition you’re talking about, it’s OK to refer to just the edition.

**Examples**  
The software-defined networking feature is available in Windows Server 2022 Datacenter and Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition but not in Windows Server 2022 Standard.  
Windows Server 2022 Essentials is a designed for small businesses with up to 25 users and 50 devices. If you’re considering adopting Essentials, it’s a good idea to move to Microsoft 365, too.  
Use this article to compare Standard, Datacenter, and Datacenter: Azure Edition editions of Windows Server 2022 to see which is best for your company.
