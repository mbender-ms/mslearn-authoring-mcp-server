# which

*Which* introduces a nonrestrictive clause, which is a clause that could be omitted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. It’s preceded by a comma. Nonrestrictive clauses often contain auxiliary or parenthetical information.

Don’t use *which* to refer to a person. Use *who* instead.

**Example**

This virtual machine template doesn't include networking configuration, which is needed when you create other virtual machines that use the template.
