# Windows Firewall

A program that blocks unauthorized network traffic flowing into or out of a local device.

**Guidelines**

All mentions: Windows Firewall 

Don't shorten to “Firewall” when referring specifically to *Windows Firewall*.  

Do not brand as *Windows Defender* or *Microsoft Defender*.  

This replaces all instances of *Windows Defender Firewall* and *Microsoft Defender Firewall*, which should no longer be used.  

Use lowercase "firewall" when referring generally to a firewall the customer is using (and not to the specific *Windows Firewall* that comes installed with Windows).
