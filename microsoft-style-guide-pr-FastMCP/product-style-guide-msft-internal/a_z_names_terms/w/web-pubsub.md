# Web PubSub

Microsoft Azure Web PubSub is a service that supports real-time publish-subscribe (PubSub) messaging for web application development through native and serverless WebSocket support.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Web PubSub

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Web PubSub

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
