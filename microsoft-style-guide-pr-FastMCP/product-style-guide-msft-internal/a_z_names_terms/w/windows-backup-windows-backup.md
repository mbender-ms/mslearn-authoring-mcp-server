# Windows Backup, Windows backup

Windows backup is the umbrella term that refers to backing up all of a user's cloud-stored info under one Microsoft account.

This includes:  

- Files and folders stored in OneDrive  
- Info from their PC like apps, settings, and preferences  
- Some settings saved in Microsoft Edge and Microsoft account

Windows Backup (title case) is a 2023 system app that merges the backup experience from these surfaces into one place.  

Windows backup (lowercase) is a page in the Windows Settings app under Accounts.  

**Guidelines**

- All mentions (system app): Windows Backup  
  *Backup* is one word, title-case. Never refer to it as the Windows Backup app.
- All mentions (settings UI): Windows backup  
  *Backup* is one word, lowercase
