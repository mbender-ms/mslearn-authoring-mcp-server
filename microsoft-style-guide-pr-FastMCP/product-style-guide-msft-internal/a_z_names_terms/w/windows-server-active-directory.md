# Windows Server Active Directory

The on-premises identity service that provides identity management and access control capabilities. (The cloud identity service is Microsoft Azure Active Directory.)

**Guidelines**

First mention: Windows Server Active Directory

Subsequent mentions: Windows Server Active Directory

After you've established the full name followed by the acronym, it's also OK to use *Windows Server AD*. But it's not acceptable to use just *AD*.

If Windows Server Active Directory appears in the same sentence as Azure Active Directory, use *on-premises Active Directory* instead of *Windows Server Active Directory*.

Don't precede with *Microsoft*.

**See** [Azure Active Directory](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-active-directory.md)
