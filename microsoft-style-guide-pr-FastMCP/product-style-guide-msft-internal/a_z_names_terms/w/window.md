# window

An area on a PC screen where apps and content appear. A window can be moved, resized, or closed.

**Examples**  
You can open multiple windows for the same Microsoft Store app so that you can look at different parts of the same document.  
You can open a new browser tab in a new window so you can look at tabs side by side.

For guidelines for referring to windows in instructions, see [Formatting text in instructions](/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.
