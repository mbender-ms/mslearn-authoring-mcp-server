# Web Apps, web app

Feature of Azure [App Service](~\a_z_names_terms\a\app-service.md) used to create and deploy mission-critical web apps that scale with your business. Also an instance of—that is, something built using—the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service. It can also refer generically to software that runs in a web browser. This follows the [industry definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application). 

**Guidelines**

First mention: Web Apps feature of Microsoft Azure App Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Web Apps

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Don't refer to this feature as *Azure Web Apps.*

Lowercase *web app* and *web apps* when referring to something built using App Service or in a generic reference.

**Examples**  
We've used the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service to build and deploy several web apps.  
My team built a web app at the Hackathon today using Web Apps.  
5 web apps, 3 mobile apps, and 12 API apps [in UI]
