# upload

In general, don't use *upload* for these actions:

- Transferring or copying content (like photos, videos, music, files, or games) from a device to a service like OneDrive or Dropbox
- Posting content to a site like a social media site or SharePoint

Instead, use a friendlier, more descriptive word like *save, share,* or *post*.

**See** [save](~\a_z_names_terms\s\save.md), [share](~\a_z_names_terms\s\share.md), [post](~\a_z_names_terms\p\post.md)
