# Ultra Disk Storage

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Ultra Disk Storage

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Ultra Disk Storage

Don't use *Ultra SSD*, which is the old name.
