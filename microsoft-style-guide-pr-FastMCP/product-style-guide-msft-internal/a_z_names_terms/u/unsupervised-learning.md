# unsupervised learning

How you refer to unsupervised learning depends on the audience and context.

In introductory material—or in UI, at the top level of the progressive disclosure—avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

In more detailed content or deeper in the user experience, especially for a maker/analyst audience, it's OK to refer to unsupervised learning when it's necessary to discuss functionality.

**Note:** This guidance will need to be reassessed periodically. Over time, AI terminology could become more familiar to a general audience, and there might be no problem with referring to unsupervised learning.
