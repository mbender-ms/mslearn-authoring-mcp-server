# user

A person who uses products such as devices, services, or applications.​

Avoid *user* when you can, replacing with *person, customer,* or a similar generic term, unless you need to distinguish a user from someone who isn't a user or an admin. There are cases where you must be specific about users (as opposed to those not registered as users in your org), and *user* is fine in those cases.

- ​ ​Always check to see whether *user* can be replaced with a friendlier word like *person, people, employee,* or the user's display name without losing meaning, especially if the context already makes it clear that the people you're talking about are the ones you're managing in the admin center.

- **User**—Use when you need to be specific about those who are registered as users in your org, when you're granting a capability by adding someone as a user, or when you need to refer a UI label or feature that uses the word *user* (such as *user account* or *fast user switching*).

- ​ **People/person**—Use when the context already makes it clear that you're talking about a user, for example, in descriptive text about what will happen after taking a particular action in admin center.

- Avoid creating new UI that uses the term *user.*

- Be careful with words like *delete* and *pin* in combination with *user* or *person.* Substitute "Remove this person" or "Pin this profile" to avoid this issue.

**Do**  
Set up accounts for other people who use your PC.  
Select **Settings** [glyph] > **Accounts** [glyph] > **Other user accounts**, and then follow the instructions.

**Don't**  
You can create an account for every user on your PC.
