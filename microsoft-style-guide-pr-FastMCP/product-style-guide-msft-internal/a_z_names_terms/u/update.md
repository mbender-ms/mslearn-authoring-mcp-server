# update

To deploy a new version of a cloud service to replace an existing deployed version. There are two options for updating: update in-place or swap virtual IP addresses. Both options update the service while it's running and without requiring the deployment to be deleted and redeployed. If the cloud service is running with more than one role instance, the update can be completed without any service downtime.

**Guidelines**

- Don't use *update* and *upgrade* interchangeably.
- Add qualifiers when referring to a specific update, for example, a *feature update*, *quality update*, or *security update*.
