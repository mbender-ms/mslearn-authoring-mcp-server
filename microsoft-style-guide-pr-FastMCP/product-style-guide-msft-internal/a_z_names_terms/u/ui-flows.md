# UI flows

In December 2020, *UI flows* was renamed to *desktop flows* in Microsoft Power Automate.

If you need to refer to UI flows in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**  

First mention: UI flows in Microsoft Power Automate  

Subsequent mentions: UI flows  

When you're referring to the feature used to create a flow, use *UI flows,* lowercase and plural.

When you're referring to a type of flow, use *UI flow* for one flow or *UI flows* to indicate multiple flows.
