# UI, user interface

Collectively, a user interface (UI) is pages, screens, buttons, forms, and other visual elements that are used to interact with the product, system, or service. For example, color palette, fonts, shapes, text, illustrations, and animations are all part of the UI.  

**Guidelines**  

When writing customer-facing material, introduce the *UI* acronym by spelling out *user interface* on the first mention, with the acronym in parentheses. It is OK to use the acronym on subsequent mentions in the same experience.  

For internal documents or for those familiar with the term *UI*, it is OK to use it without spelling it out first.  
*User interface* is sentence-case.  
Not synonymous with *user experience (UI)*.  

**See also** [UX, user experience](~\a_z_names_terms\u\ux-user-experience.md).
