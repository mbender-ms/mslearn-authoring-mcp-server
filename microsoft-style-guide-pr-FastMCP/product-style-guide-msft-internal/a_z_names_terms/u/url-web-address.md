# URL, web address

Don't substitute *internet address* for *web address.* Try to use *web address* if possible, but it's OK to use *URL.*

In Windows and Microsoft Edge, both *web address* and *URL* are acceptable.

**Examples**  
Add a web address to your message.  
Enter a URL in the address bar to go straight to a site.
