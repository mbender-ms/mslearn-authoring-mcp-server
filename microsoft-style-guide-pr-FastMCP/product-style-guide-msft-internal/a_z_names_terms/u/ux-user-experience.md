# UX, user experience

User experience (UX) refers to a personâ€™s emotions, attitude, and perceptions about a product, system, or service while interacting with it. It is based on key factors such as usability, utility, desirability, attractiveness, speed of work, among others.  

**Guidelines**  

When writing customer-facing material, introduce the *UX* acronym by spelling out *user experience* on the first mention, with the acronym in parentheses. It is OK to use the acronym on subsequent mentions in the same experience.  

For internal documents or for those familiar with the term *UX*, it is OK to use it without spelling it out first.
  
*User experience* is sentence-case.  

Not synonymous with *user interface (UI)*.  

**See also** [UI, user interface](~\a_z_names_terms\u\ui-user-interface.md).
