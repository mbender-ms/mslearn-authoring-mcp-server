# Unified Operations

Starting in October 2019, donâ€™t use *Unified Operations.* Before then, the term had the following uses:

- It was the name of the licensing plan that contained the finance and operations apps:
  - Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
  - Dynamics 365 for Retail o Dynamics 365 for Talent: Core HR.
- In Visual Studio, it was the type of project that was built for a finance and operations app.

For more information about how to refer to current licensing models, see [Dynamics 365 licensing update](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/licensing/update).

In Visual Studio, the current term is now *Finance and Operations project,* not *Unified Operations project.*

**Exception**  
On the Microsoft Docs site, *Unified Operations* must be retained as the default Search scope for finance and operations apps because help from the product requires this value. Until the query sent from the finance and operations apps is updated in the Lifecycle Services service that's used to call help, continue to use *Unified Operations* in this context.
