# Market Insights

As of April 10, 2020, Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview is no longer available as a standalone application to new customers. Market Insights functionality was incorporated into other Dynamics 365 apps. For more information, see the [Market Insights discontinuation FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/ai/market-insights/eos-faq). If you need to refer to the discontinued product, follow these guidelines.

**Guidelines**

First mention

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Market Insights

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Market Insights

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
