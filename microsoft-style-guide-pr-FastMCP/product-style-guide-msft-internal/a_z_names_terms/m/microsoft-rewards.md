# Microsoft Rewards

A program that rewards users for buying things from the Microsoft Store and performs certain activities, for example, browsing the web or reading a sponsored news article.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Rewards

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

- Subsequent mentions: Rewards

- Note: When referring to *rewards* as a noun (synonymous to gift) and/or a verb (meaning to give), use sentence-case.
