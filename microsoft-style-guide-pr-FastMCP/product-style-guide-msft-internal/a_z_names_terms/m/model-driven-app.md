# model-driven app

Lowercase. Always hyphenated.

A model-driven app is automatically generated from a data model. To learn more about model-driven apps, see [What are model-driven apps in Power Apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview).

Don't use *model-driven apps* to refer collectively to the category of apps that includes Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, and Project Service Automation. Use *customer engagement apps* instead.
