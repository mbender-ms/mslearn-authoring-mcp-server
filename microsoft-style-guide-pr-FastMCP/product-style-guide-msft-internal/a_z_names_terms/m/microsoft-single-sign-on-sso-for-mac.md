# Microsoft Single Sign On (SSO) for Mac

A new MacOS application that provides platform single sign-on capability, allowing users to register their Enterprise Azure AD account to the MacOS desktop, where they can access any M365/Azure resource without being required to login to each app independently. In addition, helps in providing device-based conditional access and evaluation.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Single Sign On (SSO) for Mac

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Single Sign On, SSO

The acronym, SSO, can be used on subsequent mentions after the full name has been introduced.
