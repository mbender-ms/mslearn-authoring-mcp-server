# Microsoft Power Platform CLI

Microsoft Power Platform CLI is a command-line interface that developers and partners can use to perform various operations in Microsoft Power Platform.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Power Platform CLI
- Subsequent mentions: Microsoft Power Platform CLI (preferred), Power Platform CLI
- Include *Microsoft* whenever possible. If space constraints make it impossible to include *Microsoft,* include it at least at first mention and on all prominent references. If the context is clear, *the CLI* by itself is acceptable.
- Include *the* in references to the CLI. You don’t need to spell out *CLI* as *command-line interface* unless you think it’s necessary for your audience.
- Don’t use the old name, *Power Apps CLI.*
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
