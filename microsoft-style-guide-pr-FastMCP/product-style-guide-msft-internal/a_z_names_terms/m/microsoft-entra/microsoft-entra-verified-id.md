# Microsoft Entra Verified ID

The cloud service that allows companies to issue and accept verifiable credentials, which users can store and manage in a digital wallet on their device and use for attestation of personal information and credentials with any organization.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Entra Verified ID  
Subsequent mentions: Verified ID  
**Note**: *Microsoft* and *Entra* should never be separated. Never say *Entra Verified ID*.  
In product UI where the brand is already present, it's OK to use just *Verified ID*.  
As of June 2022, don't use the previous name, *Azure AD Verifiable Credentials* or *verifiable credentials*.  
Always spell out the name; donâ€™t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
