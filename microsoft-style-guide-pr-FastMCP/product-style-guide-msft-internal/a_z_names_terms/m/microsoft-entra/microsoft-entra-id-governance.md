# Microsoft Entra ID Governance

Enables organizations to control user access to apps and data in the cloud and on-site. As of July 2023, this is a rebranding of the current Identity Governance solution as part of Azure Active Directory. It’s now a standalone solution under the Microsoft Entra brand.  
**  

**Guidelines**  

First mentions: Microsoft Entra ID Governance  

Subsequent mentions: ID Governance  

**Note**: *Microsoft* and *Entra* should never be separated. Never say *Entra Identity Governance*.  

In product UI where the brand is already present, it's OK to use just *Identity Governance*.  

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation, except for *ID*. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
