# Microsoft Entra Verified ID SDK

An open-source service that allows developers to implement a wallet (which users can store and manage personal information and credentials), using a standardized SDK as part of Verified ID.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Entra Verified ID SDK  
Subsequent mentions: Verified ID SDK  
**Note**: *Microsoft* and *Entra* should never be separated. Never say *Entra Verified ID SDK*.  
**In product UI where the brand is already present, it's OK to use just* Verified ID SDK*.  
Don’t spell out *software development kit*. Always use SDK.  
Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
