# Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID provides identity and access management solutions for hybrid and multicloud environments. As of July 2023, this is a rebranding of Azure Active Directory.  

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Entra ID
- Subsequent mentions: Microsoft Entra ID, Entra ID

  **Note:** While it's best practice to use the full name *Microsoft Entra* *ID* whenever possible, it's permissible to drop *Microsoft* before *Entra ID* on subsequent mentions in the following scenarios:  
  - In UI, when space is severely limited. If the brand is already present, it's OK to use just *ID*.
  - When the name is used multiple times within the same page, header, or paragraph.

- In documentation, always use *Microsoft Entra ID*, not *ID*.
- Never localize.
- Always spell out the name; donâ€™t use an acronym or abbreviation (except for ID). For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
