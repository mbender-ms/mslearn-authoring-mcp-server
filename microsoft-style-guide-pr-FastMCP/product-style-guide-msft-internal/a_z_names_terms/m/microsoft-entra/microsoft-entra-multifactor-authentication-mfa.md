# Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA)

Use for both:

- Generic references to the authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more forms of authentication.
- References to the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) feature that provides multifactor authentication in the customer's environment.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase. No hyphen.
- First mention: Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Subsequent mentions: MFA
- Features of Microsoft Entra ID don't include ID in the name. *Microsoft* is always required before *Entra*. For more information, see [New name for Azure Active Directory](/entra/fundamentals/new-name).
- You can use *MFA* as a short form for both the feature name and generic references. *MFA* is approved branding and is an exception to the rule about not using acronyms for feature names.

**Our style**  
Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requires two or more of these authentication methods.

All users and groups can be enabled for MFA.

The verification prompts are part of the Microsoft Entra ID sign-in, which automatically requests and processes the MFA challenge.

**Not our style**  
Microsoft Entra ID Multi-Factor Authentication requires two or more of these authentication methods.

All users and groups can be enabled for Multi-Factor Authentication.

The verification prompts are part of the Entra sign-in, which automatically requests and processes the Multi-Factor Authentication challenge.
