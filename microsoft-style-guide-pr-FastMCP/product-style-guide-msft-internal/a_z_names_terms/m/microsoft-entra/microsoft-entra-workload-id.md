# Microsoft Entra Workload ID

A Microsoft Entra product that enables securing and managing workloads, such as applications, service principals, managed identities, and other software components that need to access cloud resources.  

As of July 2023, this is a rebranding of the current Workload Identities solution as part of Azure Active Directory. It’s now a standalone solution under the Microsoft Entra brand.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Entra Workload ID  

Subsequent mentions: Workload ID  

**Note**: *Microsoft* and *Entra* should never be separated. Never say *Entra Workload ID*.  

In product UI where the brand is already present, it's OK to use just *Workload ID*.  

Title-cased. Localize on all markets.  

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation (except for ID). For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
