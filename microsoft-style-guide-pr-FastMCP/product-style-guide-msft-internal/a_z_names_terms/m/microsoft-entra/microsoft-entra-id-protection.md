# Microsoft Entra ID Protection

As of July 2023, Azure Identity Protection will be known as Microsoft Entra ID Protection.

**Guidelines**

- First mentions: Microsoft Entra ID Protection
- Subsequent mentions: ID Protection
- **Note**: *Microsoft* and *Entra* should never be separated. Never say *Entra ID Protection*.
- In product UI where the brand is already present, it's OK to use just *ID Protection*.
- Always spell out the name; donâ€™t use an acronym or abbreviation, except for *ID*. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
