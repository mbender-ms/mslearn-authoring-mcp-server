# Microsoft Entra External ID

An identity solution for securing access to customer-, citizen-, and partner-facing apps and services. It is the converged platform of Azure AD External Identities B2B and B2C. 

As of July 2023, this is a rebranding of the current External Identities solution as part of Azure Active Directory. It’s now a standalone solution under the Microsoft Entra brand.

**Note**: The Azure AD B2C name is not changing.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Entra External ID

**Note**: *Microsoft* and *Entra* should never be separated. Never say *Entra External ID.*

In product UI where the brand is already present, it's OK to use just *External ID*.

Subsequent mentions: External ID

Title cased, localized in all markets

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
