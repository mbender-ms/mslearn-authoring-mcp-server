# Microsoft Purview Records Management

The Microsoft Purview product that provides advanced retention, deletion, and life cycle management configuration options for content in Microsoft 365 to help customers meet recordkeeping laws and regulations. This was a feature of Microsoft Information Governance (now Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management), but Microsoft Purview Records Management is a standalone product.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Purview Records Management
- Subsequent mentions: Records Management
- In product UI that's already branded as Microsoft Purview, refer to the functionality generically as *records management.*
- Don't abbreviate as *RM*.
- In 2022, this name replaced some instances of *â€‹Microsoft Information Protection*. In the UI of Office apps and in the Microsoft Information Protection SDK, it's OK to continue to use *Microsoft Information Protection.*
