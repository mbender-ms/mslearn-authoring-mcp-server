# Microsoft Purview Information Protection

A set of offerings, services, and technologies that facilitate data protection and compliance, to help you discover, classify, and protect sensitive information wherever it lives or travels.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Purview Information Protection
- Subsequent mentions: Information Protection
- In product UI that's already branded as Microsoft Purview, refer to the functionality generically as *information protection.*
- Don't abbreviate as *IP* or *MIP.*
- In 2022, this name replaced some instances of *â€‹Microsoft Information Protection*. In the UI of Microsoft 365 apps and in the Microsoft Information Protection SDK, it's OK to continue to use *Microsoft Information Protection.*
