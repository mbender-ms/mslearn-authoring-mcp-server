# Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager

Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager is a service, available in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, that provides compliance management workflow capabilities, built-in control mapping, and recommended actions with a scoring mechanism to help organizations meet compliance requirements based on type of cloud service, industry, and geography.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Purview service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Compliance Manager

**Exception**

Include Microsoft in the app name on the first mention in third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isn’t present.
