# Microsoft Cloud

Use this term when referring to [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/what-is-microsoft-cloud#Overview "What's the Microsoft Cloud") products and solutions collectively—the Azure cloud platform plus Microsoft Security, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and our industry cloud solutions.  

When used in this meaning, *Microsoft Cloud* is capitalized.  

Include the article (*the*) before *Microsoft Cloud.*  

It’s OK to add a modifier between *the* and *Microsoft Cloud*—for example, “the trusted Microsoft Cloud.”
