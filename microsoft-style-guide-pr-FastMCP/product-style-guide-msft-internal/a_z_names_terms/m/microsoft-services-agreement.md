# Microsoft Services Agreement

The agreement between Microsoft and its end-user customers for the use of certain online consumer services provided by Microsoft. Anything installed on the customer's computer requires agreement during setup; webpages require a persistent hyperlink in the footer.

Use *Microsoft Services Agreement* on the first reference. It's OK to shorten to *the agreement* after that.

Don't use *Terms of Use, terms of use,* or *TOU*â€¯when you're referring to the Microsoft Services Agreement. They're different things.

Note that *Services* is plural.

**Example**  
Before installing, please review the Microsoft Services Agreement.

**See also** [Terms of Use](~\a_z_names_terms\t\terms-of-use-microsoft-365.md)
