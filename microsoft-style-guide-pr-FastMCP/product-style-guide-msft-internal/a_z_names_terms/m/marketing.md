# Marketing

Dynamics 365 Marketing is a marketing-automation app that helps turn prospects into business relationships.

**Guidelines**

- First mention
  - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:
  - Marketing
- Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Marketing.”
- Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

**Our style**  

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing is a relatively new app, so it's not yet available in all countries and regions. If you're located outside of a supported country or region, the setup wizard will prevent you from setting up Dynamics 365 Marketing. These geographical restrictions apply both to trial and production versions of Marketing.
