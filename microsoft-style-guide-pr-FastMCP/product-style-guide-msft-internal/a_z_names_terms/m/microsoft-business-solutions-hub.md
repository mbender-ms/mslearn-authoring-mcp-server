# Microsoft Business Solutions Hub

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Business Solutions Hub

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Business Solutions Hub
