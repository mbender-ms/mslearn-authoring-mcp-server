# Mobile Services

Azure Mobile Services is a mobile back end capable of powering cross-platform applications. Note capitalization: This name is unique in that it's really a line of integrated services.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Mobile Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Mobile Services

To avoid repeating the word *service(s)*, don't use *Mobile Services service*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
