**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Viva Insights

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Viva Insights

You may drop *Microsoft* after the first mention, but never drop *Viva*.

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).
