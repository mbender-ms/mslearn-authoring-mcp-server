# Microsoft Viva Amplify

Part of the Microsoft Viva family, Viva Amplify helps leaders create and manage their communications within Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Viva Amplify  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Viva Amplify  

You may drop *Microsoft* after the first mention, but never drop *Viva*.  

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).
