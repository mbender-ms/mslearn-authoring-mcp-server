# Microsoft Viva Topics

Part of the Microsoft Viva family of employee experience offerings, Microsoft Viva Topics uses AI to reason over an organization’s data and automatically organizes content and expertise across systems and teams into related topics, such as projects, products, processes, and customers.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Viva Topics
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

- Subsequent mentions: Viva Topics
- You may drop *Microsoft* after the first mention, but never drop *Viva*.
- Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).
