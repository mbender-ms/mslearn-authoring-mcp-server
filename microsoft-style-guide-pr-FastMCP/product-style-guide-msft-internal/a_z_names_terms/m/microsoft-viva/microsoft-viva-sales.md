# Microsoft Viva Sales

Part of the Microsoft Viva family, Microsoft Viva Sales brings everything sellers need into the flow of work. It also captures CRM data within Microsoft Teams and M 365 applications updating CRM tools automatically. 

As of August 2023, Microsoft Viva Sales will be known as [Microsoft Sales Copilot](~\copilot-guidance\copilot\microsoft-copilot-for-sales.md).

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Viva Sales

  You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Viva Sales

  You may drop *Microsoft* after the first mention, but never drop *Viva*.

  Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).
