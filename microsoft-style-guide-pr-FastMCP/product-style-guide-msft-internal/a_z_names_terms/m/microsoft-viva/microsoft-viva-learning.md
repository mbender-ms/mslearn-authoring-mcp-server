# Microsoft Viva Learning

Part of the Microsoft Viva family of employee experience offerings, Microsoft Viva Learning is a central hub for learning where people can discover, share, assign, and learn from best-in-class content libraries across an organization—including LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, third-party content providers, and an organization’s own custom content—to help teams and individuals make learning a natural part of their day.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Viva Learning

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Viva Learning

You may drop *Microsoft* after the first mention, but never drop *Viva*.

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).
