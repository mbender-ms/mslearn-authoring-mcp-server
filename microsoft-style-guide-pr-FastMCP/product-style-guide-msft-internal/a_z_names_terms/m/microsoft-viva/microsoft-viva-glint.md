# Microsoft Viva Glint

Microsoft Viva Glint is an app that helps organizations understand and improve employee engagement via surveys and recommended actions.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Viva Glint  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Viva Glint  
Branded, title-case, never localizes.
