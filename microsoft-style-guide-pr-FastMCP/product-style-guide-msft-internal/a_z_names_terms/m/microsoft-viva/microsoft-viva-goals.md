# Microsoft Viva Goals

The Microsoft Viva module that aligns teams to organizational priorities with deeply integrated and transparent goal management.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Viva Goals
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Viva Goals
- You may drop *Microsoft* from the name after the first reference, but never drop *Viva*.
- Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).
