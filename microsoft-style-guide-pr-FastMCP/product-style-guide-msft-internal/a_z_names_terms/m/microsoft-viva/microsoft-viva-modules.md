# Microsoft Viva modules

Microsoft Viva consists of separate modules. A module is a standalone portion of a product that has specific capabilities and may be used alone or in combination with other Viva modules. The term *module* should be used only when describing how Microsoft Viva is purchased and deployed.

**Guidelines for referring to an individual module**

First mention: Microsoft Viva ______

Subsequent mentions: Viva ______

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

You may drop *Microsoft* after the first mention, but never drop *Viva*.
