# Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native solution for security information and event management. It's Microsoft branded rather than Azure branded to reflect the multicloud, multiplatform scope of the product.

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: Microsoft Sentinel  
- Always include *Microsoft* to distinguish it as a Microsoft offer.  
- Don't use *Azure Sentinel.*  
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
