# MLOps

Avoid the abbreviation *MLOps.* Not all audiences know what it means, and it’s not accessible to a global audience. Instead, spell out *machine learning operations* or, even better, use descriptive wording that clearly conveys the concept, such as *the combination of machine learning and IT operations* or *the application of DevOps practices to machine-learning processes.* 

If you’re confident that your audience is familiar with *MLOps,* use it sparingly. Always spell it out or define it on the first mention. Spell out the full term or repeat the definition at least once in each major section of your content. 

Note the capitalization.
