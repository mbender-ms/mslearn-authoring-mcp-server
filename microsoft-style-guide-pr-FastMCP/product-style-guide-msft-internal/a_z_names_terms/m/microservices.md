# microservices

Small independent processes that communicate using language-agnostic APIs and that make up a larger application. This follows the [industry definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) (via Wikipedia).  

Microservices can be written in a variety of programming languages, and frameworks, and each service acts as a mini-application on its own.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase

A microservice application separates functionality into separate smaller services (3). The microservices approach scales out by deploying each service independently, creating instances of these services across servers/virtual machines/containers (4).
