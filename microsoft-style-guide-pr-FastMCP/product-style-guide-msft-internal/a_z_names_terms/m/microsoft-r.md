# Microsoft R

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Microsoft R is a distributed R platform that includes the following technologies. [Learn more](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/)

**Note:** RStudio, a popular IDE for R, isn’t a Microsoft product.

## Microsoft R

It’s OK to use *Microsoft R* as an umbrella term to refer to all Microsoft R technologies. Otherwise, refer to the specific product. When using *Microsoft R* as an umbrella term, always include *Microsoft* to distinguish the Microsoft products from the R programming language. Don’t form acronyms from any Microsoft R technology names.

## R Server

Microsoft R Server is a set of tools and optimized R packages and a parallel runtime architecture for R that can be installed on Linux, Hadoop, Teradata, or Windows.

First mention: Microsoft R Server

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the R Server name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: R Server

Use these forms to refer to the same basic R Server architecture, with different connectors:

- R Server for Hadoop
- R Server for Linux
- R Server for Teradata

Don’t use *Microsoft R Server for Windows.*

In the context of SQL Server 2016 only, it’s OK to use *R Server (standalone).* Note that *standalone* isn’t part of the product name and is lowercase.

## R Client

Microsoft R Client is a free, community-supported, data-science tool for creating R solutions that can run in Microsoft R Server or SQL Server R Services.

First mention: Microsoft R Client

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the R Client name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: R Client

## R Open

Microsoft R Open is the enhanced distribution of R from Microsoft. It’s a complete, open-source platform for statistical analysis and data science.

First mention: Microsoft R Open

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the R Open name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: R Open

## R Services

A feature included with SQL Server 2016 that makes it possible to run R using T-SQL. R Services isn’t supported in Azure SQL Database.

- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: R Services

In the context of SQL Server 2016 only, it’s OK to use *R Services (in-database).* Note that *in-database* isn’t part of the feature name and is lowercase.
