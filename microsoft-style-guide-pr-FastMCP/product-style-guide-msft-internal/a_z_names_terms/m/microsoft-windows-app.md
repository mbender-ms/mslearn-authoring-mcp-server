# Microsoft Windows App

Use the Microsoft Windows App to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop, Remote Desktop, Remote Desktop Services, Windows 365, Dev Box, and RPA Box. The Windows App connects you to the service you use to securely access Windows 11 from the device of your choice.

The Windows App replaces the apps for access to Microsoft Remote Desktop, Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Windows App  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Windows App
