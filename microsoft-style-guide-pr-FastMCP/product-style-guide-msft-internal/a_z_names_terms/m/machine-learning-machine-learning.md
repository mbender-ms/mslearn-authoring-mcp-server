# Machine Learning, machine learning

Azure Machine Learning enables customers to easily design, test, operationalize, and manage predictive analytics solutions in the cloud.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Machine Learning

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Generic references to the technology**

Lowercase *machine learning.*

Always spell out *machine learning*—don't form an acronym (*ML*).

How you refer to machine learning depends on the audience and context.

In introductory material—or in UI at the top level of the progressive disclosure—avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

In more detailed content or deeper in the user experience, especially for a maker/analyst audience, it's OK to refer to machine learning when it's necessary to discuss functionality.

**Note:** This guidance will need to be reassessed periodically. Over time, AI terminology could become more familiar to a general audience, and there might be no problem with referring to machine learning.
