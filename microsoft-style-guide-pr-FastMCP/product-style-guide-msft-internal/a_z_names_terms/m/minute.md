# minute

A minute can mean precisely 60 seconds or a brief interval.  

- For UI, in general, avoid references to indefinite periods of time. Instead, try to write around it. 
  - Remove the time reference and see if the UI works. 
  - If it doesn't, include a progress bar or other visual indication that the task is progressing, and follow the guidance in the table below. 
  - For the progress circle, use "This might take a minute." 
- Don't use the word *moment* as a substitute.
