# Microsoft Intune Suite

A per-user, per-month license plan that combines some Configuration Manager and Intune capabilities into Intune.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Microsoft Intune Suite  
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  
- Subsequent mentions: Intune Suite  
- Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms and abbreviations](~\abbreviations-and-acronyms.md).  
- Don't precede the name with *the* or *a*.
