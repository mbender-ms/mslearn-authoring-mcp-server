# Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune enables IT to configure and protect endpoints for better hybrid work experiences. This replaces Microsoft Endpoint Manager.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Intune  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Intune  

**See also** [Endpoint Manager](~/a_z_names_terms/e/endpoint-manager.md), [Configuration Manager](~\a_z_names_terms\m\microsoft-configuration-manager.md "Configuration Manager")
