# machine teaching, machine-teaching

Lowercase. Hyphenate *machine-teaching* as an adjective preceding a noun, as in "machine-teaching concepts." Don't hyphenate in other instances.

Always spell out *machine teaching.* Don't form an acronym (*MT*).

How you refer to machine teaching depends on the audience and context.

In introductory material—or in UI, at the top level of the progressive disclosure—avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

In more detailed content or deeper in the user experience, especially for a maker/analyst audience, it's OK to refer to machine teaching when it's necessary to discuss functionality. *Machine teaching* is an emergent term, so even with a maker/analyst audience, make sure the meaning is clear and define the term if necessary.
