# Mobile Apps, mobile app

Feature of Azure [App Service](~\a_z_names_terms\a\app-service.md) to create mobile apps that engage employees, partners, and customers on any device, at any time. The generic term, _mobile apps,_ should be used when referring to apps made using the Mobile Apps feature or another technology or tool.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Mobile Apps feature of Microsoft Azure App Service

You can omit _Microsoft_ if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word _Microsoft_ has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Mobile Apps

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Don't refer to this feature as _Azure Mobile Apps._

Don't confuse this with the [mobile version of the Azure portal](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-mobile-app.md).

General reference: mobile app, mobile apps

**Examples**  
We've used the Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service to build and deploy several mobile apps.  
My team built a mobile app at the hackathon.  
5 web apps, 3 mobile apps, and 12 API apps [in UI]
