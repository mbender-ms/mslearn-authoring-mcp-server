# Microsoft account

Our audience for Microsoft account is the Microsoft consumer audience. A Microsoft account is your account for all things Microsoft. It enables every customer to get the most out of their Microsoft experience.  

Microsoft has two identity stacks: Microsoft account for consumer propositions, and Azure Active Directory, more commonly known as work or school accounts. What's the difference?  

- **A Microsoft account** (created by you for personal use) provides access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services such as Outlook.com (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Microsoft 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. A Microsoft account can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure.

- **A work or school account** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) provides access to cloud services such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, and Office 365. When a customer signs up as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent their organization. After this directory has been created, an admin can then create users and assign licenses to them based on which cloud service subscriptions they need access to, such as Azure.

**Guidelines**  

Note capitalization.  
Don't use _MSA_.  
It's OK to use _your account_ when there's no ambiguity.  
For sign up/sign in, always specify which account type you mean: _work or school account_ or _Microsoft account_.
