# media

Donâ€™t use in place of, or as shorthand for, the term *digital media,* unless the context is already clear from prior use of the full term.

Avoid using *media* to refer to a single item, as in the sentence, "Insert the media into the drive." Instead, be as specific as possible about what type of media you mean.

**Examples**  
Upload photos and videos to OneDrive.  
Insert the storage device into the USB port.  
You can stream most types of digital media files.
