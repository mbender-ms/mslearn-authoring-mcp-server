# Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is an app that creates a shared workspace that includes chat, meetings, calling, video conferencing, file sharing and storage, and collaboration.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Teams  
Subsequent mentions: Teams  
In Microsoft and third-party marketing communications, always use the full name in the first mention (preferably in a prominent position) in a given communication, such as banner ads, emails, and social posts. In communications with multiple pages, such as e-books, white papers, and the web, use the full name in the first mention on every page.

**Exception**  
On packaging, use the full name *Microsoft Teams* on every reference.  
In UI where space is limited, if the page is clearly branded as Microsoft, it's OK to shorten *Microsoft Teams* to just *Teams.*  
In documentation, use the full name in the first reference within the page or section, and then it's OK to shorten to just *Teams* in subsequent mentions within that same page or section.  
*Microsoft Teams* remains in English in all markets.

**Microsoft Teams (free)**

The version or offering of Microsoft Teams that is free.

Refer to this free version as Microsoft Teams, and when needed, specify the version or SKU by adding clarifiers ("free" or "for personal and small business use"). The clarifiers are not part of the product/version name.

**Examples**:

- Microsoft Teams for personal and small business use. 
- Microsoft Teams for personal use. 
- Microsoft Teams for small business. 
- The free version of Microsoft Teams. This is appropriate for comparing SKUs or referencing in copy. 
- Microsoft Teams (free). This is appropriate for comparing SKUs in a SKU chooser.

In external communications, the following terms should not be used: Microsoft Teams Free, Teams Free, Teams Unified, Teams for Life. In particular, "free" (in any form of capitalization) shouldnâ€™t be used as a noun, but as a label or an adjective instead.
