# Microsoft Teams Connect

The category name for a group of features that enable collaboration with external users in Microsoft Teams, including chat, teams, and shared channels.  

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Teams Connect
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Teams Connect

For use in marketing but not in product UI or documentation.  

Don't use the phrases "shared chat" or "shared teams," to describe the features included in Microsoft Teams Connect, but instead describe specific scenarios within chat and teams.
