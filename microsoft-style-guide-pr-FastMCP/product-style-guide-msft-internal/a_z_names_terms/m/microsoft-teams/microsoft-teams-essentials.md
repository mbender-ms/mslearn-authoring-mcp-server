# Microsoft Teams Essentials

Microsoft Teams Essentials is a standalone product for small businesses and consumers, which they can sign in to with a personal Microsoft account, rather than a work or school account.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Teams Essentials

Subsequent mentions: Teams Essentials

In Microsoft and third-party marketing communications, always use the full name in the first mention (preferably in a prominent position) in a given communication, such as banner ads, emails, and social posts. In communications with multiple pages, such as e-books, white papers, and the web, use the full name in the first mention on every page.

**Exception**  
On packaging, use the full name *Microsoft Teams Essentials* on every reference.

In UI where space is limited, if the page is clearly branded as Microsoft, it's OK to shorten *Microsoft Teams Essentials* to just *Teams Essentials.*

In documentation, use the full name in the first reference within the page or section, and then it's OK to shorten to just *Teams Essentials* in subsequent mentions within that same page or section.
