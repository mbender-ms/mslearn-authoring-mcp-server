You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies: 

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Teams Phone Mobile
