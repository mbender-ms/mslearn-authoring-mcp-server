# Approvals in Microsoft Teams

A Microsoft Teams app that lets you create, manage, and share approvals with your team or partners. You'll be able to create new approvals, view the ones sent your way, and see all of your previous approvals in one place.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Approvals in Microsoft Teams  
- Subsequent mention: Approvals, Approvals app  
- When referring to *approval* as a generic term and not the app, lowercase.
