# Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing  
Subsequent mentions: Teams Audio Conferencing  
In Microsoft and third-party marketing communications, always use the full name in the first mention (preferably in a prominent position) in a given communication, such as banner ads, emails, and social posts. In communications with multiple pages, such as e-books, white papers, and the web, use the full name in the first mention on every page.

**Exception**  
On packaging, use the full name *Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing* on every reference.

In UI where space is limited, if the page is clearly branded as Microsoft, it's OK to shorten *Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing* to just *Teams Audio Conferencing.*

In documentation, use the full name in the first reference within the page or section, and then it's OK to shorten to just *Teams Audio Conferencing* in subsequent mentions within that same page or section.
