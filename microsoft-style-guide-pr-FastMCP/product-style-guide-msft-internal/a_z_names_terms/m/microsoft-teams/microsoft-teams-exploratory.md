# Microsoft Teams Exploratory

An offering that gives end users the ability to get the full Microsoft Teams experience that their company may already have for other licensed users in their organization.  
If you already have an Azure Active Directory account and you’re not yet licensed to use Microsoft Teams, you can initiate a 12-month Teams Exploratory subscription.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Teams Exploratory  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Teams Exploratory
