# Updates in Microsoft Teams

The Updates application for Teams provides a platform for members of an organization to create, assign, review, and submit forms for common activities within the organization.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Updates in Microsoft Teams  
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Updates  

- Lowercase when referring to an instance (something being built using the service): *update*, *updates*
