# Microsoft Teams Premium

The paid Microsoft Teams offering with additional features that enables premium capabilities for additional meeting scenarios, including Virtual appointments and webinars.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Teams Premium
- Subsequent mentions: Teams Premium
- In Microsoft and third-party marketing communications, always use the full name in the first mention. In communications with multiple pages, such as e-books, white papers, and the web, use the full name in the first mention on every page.

**Exceptions**

- On packaging, use the full name Microsoft Teams Premium on every reference.
- In UI where space is limited, if the page is clearly branded as Microsoft, it's OK to shorten Microsoft Teams Premium to just Teams Premium.
- In documentation, use the full name in the first reference within the page or section, and then it's OK to shorten to just Teams Premium in subsequent mentions within that same page or section.
