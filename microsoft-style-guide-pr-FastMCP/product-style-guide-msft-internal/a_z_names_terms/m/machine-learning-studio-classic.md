# Machine Learning Studio (classic)

Released in 2015, Azure Machine Learning Studio was a standalone service that offered a visual machine-learning model builder in Azure.

Support for Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) will end on August 31, 2024. Customers are encouraged to transition to Azure Machine Learning by that date.

**Guidelines**

To distinguish *Machine Learning studio* (the web portal for Azure Machine Learning) from the retired, standalone service, include *(classic)* after the name *Machine Learning Studio*.

Also note that the retired service used *Studio,* capitalized, but the current web portal has *studio,* lowercase.
