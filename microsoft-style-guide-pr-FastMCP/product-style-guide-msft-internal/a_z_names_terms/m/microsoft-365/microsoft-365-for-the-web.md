# Microsoft 365 for the web

The suite of web-based productivity offerings from Office. These are stand-alone applications that offer access to Office documents through any browser across multiple platforms. Capabilities include lightweight creation, and editing in standard Office formats, sharing and real-time collaboration through the browser, and a variety of web-enabled scenarios.

**Guidelines**

- Drop the term *Online* from the following product names:
  - Word Online
  - Excel Online
  - PowerPoint Online
  - OneNote Online
  - Visio Online

- Do not refer to Microsoft 365 apps as *Office* unless referring exclusively to one-time purchase, perpetual versions thereof, such as Office LTSC or Office 2019

- Do not refer to these apps as *Web apps*. Microsoft 365 is just Microsoft 365, Word is just Word, etc., no matter what platform you are consuming it on.

- If you need to specify the web version of these products and the simple product name isn’t enough, you can use one of the following qualifiers:
  - *​foo for the web* - Example: Word for the web
  - *foo on the web* - Example: Excel on the web
  - *foo on Microsoft365.com* - Example: PowerPoint on Microsoft365.com
  - *web version of foo* - Example: “…web version of OneNote”
  - *foo in a browser* – Example: “Word in a browser”

These changes apply to all references to these app names with “Online” in the title and references to app names with “Web Apps”.
