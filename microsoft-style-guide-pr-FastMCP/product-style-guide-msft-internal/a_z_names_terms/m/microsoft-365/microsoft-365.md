# Microsoft 365

When referring to the Microsoft 365 brand name or any of the individual Microsoft 365 editions or products, follow these guidelines.

- Always include *Microsoft;* don’t shorten to just *365.* 
- Always spell out *Microsoft 365.* Don’t abbreviate the name or create acronyms, such as *M365.* 
- When you’re referring to Microsoft 365 for a specific audience, the correct references are:
  - Microsoft 365 for business
  - Microsoft 365 for enterprise
  - Microsoft 365 for family
  - Microsoft 365 for education

  Note that these aren’t specific products or plans, but rather how we talk collectively about Microsoft 365 offerings that are aimed at those specific audiences.

- Use title-style capitalization when you’re referring to a specific Microsoft 365 product by name. For a list, see [Microsoft 365 SKU names](~\product-and-feature-names\microsoft-365-sku-names.md). For information about a specific app or SKU name, see that topic in the [A–Z names and terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md).
- Always use numerals for *365;* don’t spell out the number.
- Always include a space between *Microsoft* and *365.*
- In speech, the correct pronunciation in English is “Microsoft three sixty-five” or “Microsoft three six five," not “three hundred sixty-five.” 
- Never separate *Microsoft* from *365.* They should always appear on the same line.
