# Machine Learning packages

A set of Python package extensions to Azure Machine Learning for deep-learning scenarios and to help data scientists build, train, fine-tune and deploy highly accurate and efficient models for computer vision, text analytics, and financial forecasting.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning packages

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Machine Learning packages

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
