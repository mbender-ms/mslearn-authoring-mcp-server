# minutes, min

**Guidelines**

Spell out *minute* and *minutes* wherever possible, as in "Duration: 55 minutes." Examples: "Updated 12 minutes ago," "25-minute meeting"

In extremely small UI spaces where *minute* or *minutes* would truncate, it's OK to abbreviate to *min* with no period. Examples: "Updated 12 min ago," "25-min meeting"

Use the plural form, never *minute(s).* This is aligned to Microsoft style and Chicago Manual of Style direction against using (s) in favor of using the plural. It also avoids localization.
