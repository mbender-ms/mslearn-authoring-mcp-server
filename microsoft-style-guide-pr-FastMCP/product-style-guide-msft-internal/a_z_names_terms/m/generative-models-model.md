# generative models, model

Generative AI models (also referred to as generative models or just models) are a subset of deep learning models that can produce new content based on what is described in the input.  

**Guidelines**

In AI-enabled technology, *model* has a specific meaning. To avoid confusion, don't use *model* in a general sense. Instead, use *plan, template, pattern,* or another appropriate synonym.

It's OK to use *model* when you're referring to something that really is a model in the AI and machine learning sense.

For an end-user audience, avoid focusing on the technology. Instead of talking about models, talk about what the user wants to do.

For a maker/analyst audience, it's OK to refer to models when it's necessary to discuss functionality.

**Generative AI terminology: GPT, Copilot, generative AI**

The terms *GPT, Copilot,* and *generative AI* are not interchangeable:

- Do not use GPT as shorthand to refer to Copilot AI assistance.  GPT is a specific type of generative AI and generative AI model.  

- Do not use GPT as shorthand for generative AI. GPT is a specific type of generative AI, but they are not exactly the same thing and the terms are not interchangeable. *GPT* and *generative AI* have distinct meanings and refer to different things:  

  - Generative AI is a broad category of AI that includes any AI system that can generate new data or content, such as text, images, or music.  

  - GPT is a specific type of generative AI that uses a pre-trained neural network architecture called a transformer to generate high-quality content. But GPT is only one of many other types of generative AI such as variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) used to generate images, video, and other output.
