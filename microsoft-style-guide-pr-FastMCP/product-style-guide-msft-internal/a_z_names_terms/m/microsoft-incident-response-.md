# Microsoft Incident Response

A rename of an existing offering: Microsoft Security Services for Incident Response. This service removes a bad actor from the customer’s environment, builds resilience for future attacks, and mends defenses after a breach.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Incident Response
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Incident Response
- Localize on all markets.
