# Microsoft Edge

A web browser first created for Windows 10.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Edge  
Subsequent mentions: Edge

- It's OK to shorten to *Edge* on the first mention if there are space constraints, but only if the fully branded name is prominently featured in the same flow.

- Put a nonbreaking space between *Microsoft* and *Edge* so that it doesn't break or wrap to another line.

- If you're grouping Microsoft Edge with another Microsoft-branded product (such as Microsoft Bing), don't repeat *Microsoft.*  
  **Example**  
  Microsoft Edge and Bing

- Don't localize. Use *Microsoft Edge* in all markets.

Note on versions:

The current, Chromium-based version is referred to as *Microsoft Edge*. The previous version of Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) may be referred to as *Microsoft Edge Legacy*.
