# Microsoft Cashback

Formerly known as the cashback feature in Microsoft Edge.  

**Guidelines**

First mentions: Microsoft Cashback, Cashback from Microsoft

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Cashback, Cashback program

*Cashback* is always localized.

When referencing what the customer is receiving, use *cash back* (lowercase, two words).

**Example:** You are receiving 10% cash back.
