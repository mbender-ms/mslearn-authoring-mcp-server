# memory

Use *memory* only to refer to application memory or RAM.   

In general, don't use *memory* to refer to space or storage where customers save files.  

Use *space* to refer generically to storage. Use *storage space* if you need to be specific.

**See also** [space](~\a_z_names_terms\s\space.md), [storage](~\a_z_names_terms\s\storage.md)
