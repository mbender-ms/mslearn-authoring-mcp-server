# Microsoft Graph

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Graph
- Subsequent mentions: Microsoft Graph
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
- When the name appears by itself (as a noun), don’t precede it with “the.” But if the name functions as an adjective, the name can be preceded by “the.”
- Lowercase when referring to an instance/output of using the service: graph
