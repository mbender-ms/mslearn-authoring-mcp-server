# Microsoft Designer

Microsoft Designer is an application powered by DALL-E image technology, where content can be created from pre-created and AI-suggested templates.  
​​Designer is a feature across multiple apps, but also now a standalone app.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Microsoft Designer  

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Designer
