# Microsoft Customer Agreement

A streamlined digital agreement that updates dynamically and doesn't expire. Whether customers buy from a partner, from a Microsoft sales rep, or on the web, they sign the same basic agreement—the Microsoft Customer Agreement.  

**Guidelines**  

- Call it the *Microsoft Customer Agreement* on first mention. In subsequent mentions it can be called the *customer agreement* or *the agreement* if appropriate for the audience.  
- When shortening to *customer agreement*, don’t capitalize it.  

  **Example**  

  Make all of your cloud purchases under the same Microsoft Customer Agreement, whether you buy from a partner, from your Microsoft sales rep, or on the web.

- Always spell out the name; never use an acronym or abbreviation like MCA. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md) in the *Microsoft Cloud Style Guide*.
