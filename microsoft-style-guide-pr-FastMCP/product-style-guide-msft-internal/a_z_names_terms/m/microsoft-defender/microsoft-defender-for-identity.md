# Microsoft Defender for Identity

The cloud service that helps you protect your enterprise hybrid environments from multiple types of advanced, targeted cyberattacks and insider threats. In November 2021, Microsoft Defender for Identity became the new name for Azure Advanced Threat Protection.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Subsequent mentions: Defender for Identity
  - If you’re referring repeatedly to Defender for Identity, it’s OK to use just *Defender* after you’ve introduced the full product name and the context makes it clear which product you’re talking about.
  - In the UI where space is very limited, it’s OK to use the acronym *MDI.* Avoid using the acronym elsewhere.
