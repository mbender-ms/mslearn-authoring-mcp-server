# Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (EASM) derived from RiskIQ technologies. EASM helps customers discover internet-facing assets and systems, identify risks, vulnerabilities, exposures, and compliance issues.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (EASM)
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word Microsoft has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

- Subsequent mentions: Defender External Attack Surface Management, External Attack Surface Management, Defender EASM
- In product UI where branding is already present, if space is limited, it is OK to use EASM without branding. If there might be confusion between the product and the industry term, it's OK to use *Defender EASM*.
- Never use EASM (acronym) without branding in marketing materials.
