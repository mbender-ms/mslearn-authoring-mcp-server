# Microsoft Defender

Microsoft Defender is a Microsoft Security product experience that spans both consumer and commercial audiences.

Several subscriptions and apps use this name, most with descriptors following, such as *for Business* or *for Endpoint.*

**Guidelines**

Use *Microsoft Defender* in the first and most prominent references to any Microsoft Defender product.

You can shorten *Microsoft Defender* to *Defender* (or *Defender for Foo,* as appropriate) on subsequent mentions in the same flow or article, for example, in documentation where the name is frequently repeated.

Never shorten to *Defender* in any prominent placement, such as a link, headline, or product splash screen.

**For consumer audiences,** the name of the app is *Microsoft Defender* with no descriptor. The descriptor *for individuals* (with a lowercase *i*) can be added after *Microsoft Defender* when you need to distinguish the consumer offering from commercial Microsoft Defender offerings.

**For commercial audiences,** always use the full name of the specific subscription on the first mention and in prominent locations. Microsoft Defender subscriptions for commercial audiences include, among others:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Business
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

Subsequent references, where the name is used repeatedly in the same flow, can be shortened to just *Microsoft Defender* if the context makes it clear which Defender product is described, or to *Defender for Foo* if the specific product is needed. Avoid the use of *Defender* by itself without modifiers of any kind.

Avoid acronyms such as MDE, MDO, or MDB for any Microsoft Defender product unless space is severely constrained as in a column heading in the product experience. If used, make sure the full product name appears prominently on the same page with the associated acronym in parentheses.

**The mobile app** is named *MS Defender.* This name should never be shortened, even when there are character limitations.

*Microsoft Defender* is branded and should remain in English in all markets. Do not localize.
