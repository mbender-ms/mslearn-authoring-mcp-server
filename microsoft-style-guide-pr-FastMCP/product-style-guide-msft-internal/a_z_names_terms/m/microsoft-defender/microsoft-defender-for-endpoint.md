# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is the unified security platform for preventative protection, postbreach detection, automated investigation, and response. 

In November 2021, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint became the new name for Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP).

**Guidelines** 

First mention: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint 

Subsequent mentions: Defender for Endpoint 

- If you’re referring repeatedly to Defender for Endpoint, it’s OK to use just *Defender* after you’ve introduced the full product name and the context makes it clear which product you’re talking about.

- In the UI where space is very limited, it’s OK to use the acronym *MDE.* Avoid using the acronym elsewhere.

- When additional context is needed—for example, when you’re documenting platform support beyond Windows—place the context at the end of the name in parentheses:
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Mac)
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Linux)
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (iOS/Android)
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (server)
