# Managed Lustre

The Azure Managed Lustre service is a managed, pay-as-you-go Lustre file system running in Azure to support high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Managed Lustre

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Managed Lustre

Note that *Lustre* uses an alternate spelling (not the preferred, US English spelling *Luster*) because it’s a reference to the open-source Lustre file system.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
