# Microsoft SharePoint Premium

This is an expansion of Microsoft Syntex as a premium version of SharePoint.

SharePoint Premium is a set of SKUs derived from the current Microsoft Syntex family that provides additional value to content management and experiences in Microsoft 365. In the SharePoint Premium family, customers will get a subset of Copilot in SharePoint as well as many of the previously branded Syntex capabilities. Some in the seat license as some as metered PayGo services.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft SharePoint Premium

You can omit **Microsoft** if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word **Microsoft** has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: SharePoint Premium
