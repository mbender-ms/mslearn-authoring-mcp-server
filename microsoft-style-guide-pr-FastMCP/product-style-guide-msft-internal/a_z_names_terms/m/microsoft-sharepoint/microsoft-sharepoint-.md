# Microsoft SharePoint

SharePoint is primarily a document management and storage system. It’s highly configurable and usage varies by organization.

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: SharePoint
  - **Exception:** Include *Microsoft* in the app name on the first mention in third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isn’t present.
- The cloud-based version of SharePoint, formerly known as *SharePoint Online*, is now called *SharePoint in Microsoft 365*.
- The recent on-premises versions of SharePoint are called *SharePoint Server* + year number. The exception is the final on-premises version of SharePoint Server, released in 2021, which is called *SharePoint Server Subscription Edition*. It is the last major release of SharePoint Server because it allows customers to stay up to date just by installing updates. Microsoft provides ongoing support and updates for as long as the subscription is current/valid.
- One word. Capitalize the *P*.
