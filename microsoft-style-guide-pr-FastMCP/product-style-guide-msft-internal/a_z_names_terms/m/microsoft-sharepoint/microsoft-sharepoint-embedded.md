# Microsoft SharePoint Embedded

Microsoft SharePoint Embedded is a service that allows developers and partners to build content applications that leverage the Microsoft 365 back end (versioning, coauthoring, search, security, compliance, and sharing) so they can build apps that go beyond Microsoft 365.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft SharePoint Embedded
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: SharePoint Embedded
