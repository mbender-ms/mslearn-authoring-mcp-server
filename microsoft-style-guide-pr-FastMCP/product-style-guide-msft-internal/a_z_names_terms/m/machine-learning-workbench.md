# Machine Learning Workbench

Don't use. In the September 2018 release, Azure Machine Learning Workbench was deprecated and replaced by other features. For more information, see [What happened to Azure Machine Learning Workbench?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-happened-to-workbench)

If you need to refer to Machine Learning Workbench in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Workbench

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Machine Learning Workbench

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
