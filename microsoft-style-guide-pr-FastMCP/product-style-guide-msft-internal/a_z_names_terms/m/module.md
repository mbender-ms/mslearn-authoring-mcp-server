# module

An integrated app component that extends an underlying product with specific functions and processes. Modules may be licensed individually or in combination as a suite of modules. A module cannot function on its own, and a subscription to the underlying product is required.  

Modular software, like Microsoft Viva and learning modules in Power Apps, makes it easy for customers to add functionality while keeping the same foundation in place.

Use sparingly: Each Microsoft Viva module has specific capabilities and is experienced within Teams or other Microsoft tools.

**Guidelines**  

Module names use sentence-style capitalization. That is, they’re lowercase unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence, UI label, or similar text string. (To learn more about sentence-style capitalization, see [Capitalization standards](~\capitalization-standards\capitalization-standards.md).)

**Examples**  
The procurement and sourcing module covers all the steps from identifying a need for product and services through procuring the product, receipt, invoicing, and processing of payment with vendors.  

Procurement + sourcing [_UI label_]

Viva Topics, the Viva Topics module  

Viva Learning, the Viva Learning module

**Known exceptions**  

Some Dynamics 365 apps use the term _module_ [differently] to refer to areas of functionality, [which isn't aligned with the core definition in our brand naming system]. These are known exceptions:  

- **Dynamics 365 Commerce:** In Commerce, modules are logical building blocks that make up the structure of the customer’s e-commerce pages. Modules are grouped according to their purpose and scope. The Dynamics 365 Commerce module library is a collection of modules that can be used to build an e-commerce website. Modules are implemented both as UI elements and in the underlying functional behavior.  

- **Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management:** In Supply Chain Management, a module is a grouping of related functionality, such as for warehouse management or asset management. Modules are exposed in the Supply Chain Management product UI under the group label _Modules._

**Examples**

The human resources module of Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations  

Expense management module
