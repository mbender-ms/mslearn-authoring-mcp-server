# Microsoft Check In

The Microsoft 365 app allows users in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 to communicate on work progress.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Check In  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Check In  

Title-cased. Don’t localize.  

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
