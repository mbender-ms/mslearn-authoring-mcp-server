# Microsoft Edge Secure Network

Microsoft Edge Secure Network is an in-browser VPN service built into Microsoft Edge that allows users to add additional protection byâ€¯hiding their IP address as traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Edge Secure Network

Subsequent mentions: Edge Secure Network

It's OK to omit *Microsoft* on the first mention if there are space constraints, but only if the full name is prominently featured in the same flow.
