# Media Player

Media Player is a web video player built to play back media content from Microsoft Azure Media Services on a wide variety of browsers and devices.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Media Player

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Media Player

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Lowercase when referring generically to media players and not the Azure Media Player service specifically.
