# Media Services

The category of Azure services that includes encoding, format conversion, on-demand streaming, content protection, and live streaming services.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Media Services
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent: Media Services
  - Note that both words in *Media Services* are capitalized, unlike the names of other Azure service categories.
  - To avoid repeating the word *service(s)*, don't use *Media Services service*.
  - Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
