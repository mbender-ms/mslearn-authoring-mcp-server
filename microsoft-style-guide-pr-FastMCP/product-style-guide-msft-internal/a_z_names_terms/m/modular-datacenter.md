# Modular Datacenter

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Modular Datacenter (MDC)

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: MDC

- It's OK to include *Azure* in subsequent mentions if you think it adds clarity or helps reinforce the Azure brand name.

- The use of the *MDC* acronym is an exception to the general [guideline](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md) that prohibits acronyms in place of product names.
