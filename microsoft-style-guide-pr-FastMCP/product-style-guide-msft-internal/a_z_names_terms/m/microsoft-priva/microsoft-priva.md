# Microsoft Priva

Microsoft Priva helps organizations safeguard personal data.

**Guidelines**

​First mention: Microsoft Priva

Subsequent mentions: Priva

- There isn't one single product named *Priva*—Priva is a collection of solutions under the Priva brand name.

- The individual Priva product names can omit *Microsoft* or *Priva* whenever the brand context is established.  
  **Example**  
  On the Microsoft Security website, if there's a header that reads "Microsoft Priva," you can use just *Privacy Risk Management* or *Subject Rights Requests*.

- Avoid using *Privacy Management for Microsoft 365* or any similar *for* construction.
