# Metrics Advisor

Metrics Advisor is an Azure service within Azure Applied AI Services that uses AI to perform data monitoring and anomaly detection in time series data.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Metrics Advisor
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Metrics Advisor
  - The context should make clear that Metrics Advisor is part of Azure Applied AI Services.
  - Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
