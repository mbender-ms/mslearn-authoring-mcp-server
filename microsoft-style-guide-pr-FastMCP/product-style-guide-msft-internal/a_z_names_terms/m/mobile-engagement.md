# Mobile Engagement

Mobile Engagement is a user-engagement platform that provides data-driven insights into app usage and real-time user segmentation. It enables contextually aware push notifications and in-app messaging.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Mobile Engagement
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Mobile Engagement
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
