# Microsoft Cloud Germany

A Microsoft cloud with a German data trustee. It delivers a separate instance of Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics CRM Online from German datacenters with a dedicated network. The data trustee, T-Systems, is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom and controls access to customer data under German law.

Microsoft Cloud Germany includes:

- Microsoft Azure Germany
- Office 365 Germany
- Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online Germany  

**Guidelines**

- *Microsoft Cloud Germany* is a collection of offerings and not a brand.
- *Microsoft Azure Germany* is the name for Azure in Germany.
- *Microsoft Cloud Deutschland* and *Microsoft Azure Deutschland* are the German-language references to Azure in Germany.
- *Germany* appended to the names above indicates a local *instance* of these products that, in this case, addresses data sovereignty.
- The offerings are available to partners and customers in the EU/EFTA. Other EU/EFTA users subscribe to the global offerings (that is, Office 365 rather than Office 365 Germany).
