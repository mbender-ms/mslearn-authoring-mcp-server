# deprecate, deprecated

Used to describe a feature, functionality, or service that is no longer in active development. A deprecated feature may be soon retired or removed from future releases.  

Jargon. Donâ€™t use in content for an external-facing audience.  

Not synonymous with *obsolete, end of support,* or *retire*.  

**Example**:  
Windows Vista was deprecated on July 10, 2015, while support for it was retired in Version 1511.
