# disable, disabled

Avoid *disable* to refer to making a command or function inactive. Replace with specific, plain language for what is happening, such as *turn off, hide, make unavailable, make inactive, block,* or *remove,* as appropriate.

As a state, replace *disabled* with descriptors such as *inactive, unavailable,* or *off.*

**Exceptions**

- Use *disable* in documentation if that matches what's in the UX (if you can’t change the UX).
- In UX, it’s OK to use *disable* for consistency with legacy UX on the same screen that you can't change, but avoid it in new user experiences.
- When an admin is preventing users from installing an app, turning a setting on, or setting something up, it's OK to use *enable/disable* for that overarching admin control. But write around this if you can reasonably do so.
