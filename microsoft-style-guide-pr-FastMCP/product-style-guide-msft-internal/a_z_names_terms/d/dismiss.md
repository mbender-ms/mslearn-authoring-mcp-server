# dismiss

To make a notification (usually a reminder or calendar alarm) disappear from the screen.

- *Dismiss* and *Snooze* are usually presented together in the UI.
- Don't use *Dismiss* to indicate closing a dialog box. Use *Close, OK,* or *Cancel* instead.

**Example**  
If you want to unlock your device, you'll need to dismiss the reminder first.
