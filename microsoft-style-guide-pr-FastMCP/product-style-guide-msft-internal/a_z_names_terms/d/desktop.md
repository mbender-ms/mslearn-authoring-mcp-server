# desktop

A PC that fits conveniently on a desk or table and isn’t designed to be portable.  
-or-  
The work area on the screen that is provided by the operating system.  

The work area provided by the operating system includes the Recycle Bin and other icons. Files and folders can appear "on" the desktop, be saved "to" the desktop, and be opened "from" the desktop.

**Guidelines**  

- Don’t use *desktop view* or other descriptions that characterize the desktop as a view or a mode.
- Instead, use *open the desktop* to reinforce how to access it. Don’t refer to the desktop as an app.
- Don’t refer to the desktop as a "place" (such as *go to the desktop*). It’s a feature of Windows that you can open.
- Okay to use as a modifier if needed to differentiate items that have the same name.
