# default

An automatic setting that persists unless the customer explicitly changes it.

Avoid unless necessary to differentiate one state from another in technical documentation. It's often implied and adds no new information.

Avoid *by default* altogether.

**Example**  
Select a font size for new items. [Adding *default* would impart no new information.]
