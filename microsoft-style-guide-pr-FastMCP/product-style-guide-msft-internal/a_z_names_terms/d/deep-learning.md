# deep learning

**How you refer to deep learning depends on the audience and context.**

In introductory material—or in UI, at the top level of the progressive user experience—avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

In more deeper in the disclosure, especially for a maker/analyst audience, it's OK to refer to deep learning when it's necessary to discuss functionality.

**Note:** This guidance will need to be reassessed periodically. Over time, end users will become more familiar with AI terminology, and there may be no problem with referring to deep learning.
