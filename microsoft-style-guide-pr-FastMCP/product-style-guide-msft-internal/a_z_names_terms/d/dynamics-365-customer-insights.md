# Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights is a product that enables users to turn data-driven insights into personalized customer journeys across marketing, sales, and service.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

Branded, title-cased, never localize.

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
