# Digital Messaging for Dynamics 365 Customer Service

The Digital Messaging Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides the same capabilities as the Chat add-in, but it also allows customers to connect other digital messaging channels into their overall omnichannel support experience.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Digital Messaging Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Digital Messaging for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Digital Messaging

Capitalize *Digital Messaging* only in references to the product. In general references, use lowercase. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
