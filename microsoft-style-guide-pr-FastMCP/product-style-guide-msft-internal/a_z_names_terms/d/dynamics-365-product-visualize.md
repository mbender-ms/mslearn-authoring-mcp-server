# Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

Dynamics 365 Product Visualize is a mixed-reality tool for showcasing a seller's product in 3D so the seller's customers can explore it in their own environment.

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
