# Don't show this message again

"Don't show this message again" is a checkbox label that displays in recurring, noncritical messages.

- Always use the full phrase "Don't show this message again." Don't omit the word *message*.
- Don't use the phrases "Don't prompt me about this again" or "Dismiss prompt"â€”they're wordy and technical.
