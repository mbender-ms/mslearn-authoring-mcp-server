# dedicated capacity

Donâ€™t use. The term *dedicated capacity* is misleading because there is no dedicated hardware offering in Power BI capacities.

You rarely need a modifier for *capacity* because capacity is referenced in the context of Premium or Embedded, but if you do, use *reserved capacity* instead of *dedicated capacity*.
