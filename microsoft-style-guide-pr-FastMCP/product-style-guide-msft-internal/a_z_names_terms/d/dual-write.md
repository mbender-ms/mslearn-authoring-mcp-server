# dual-write

The dual-write feature allows Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management customers to natively get their data in Dataverse with near real-time integration.

**Guidelines**

Lowercase. Always hyphenate *dual-write,* as a noun and an adjective.

**Our style**  
Once an entity in Dynamics 365 Finance or Supply Chain Management is enabled for dual-write, any change results in a near real-time update to Dataverse, and vice versa.  
Dual-write is currently in preview. A simple and intuitive dual-write user interface in the Power Apps maker portal is expected to be available in March 2020.
