# data plan

The part of the service agreement with a mobile operator that describes how you pay for the data you use when doing things like browsing the internet over your cellular data connection (and not over Wi-Fi).

- Two words.
- Use only to refer to billing.
- Don't use *data plan* to refer to connectivity.

**Example**  
You'll need to check your data plan with your mobile operator.
