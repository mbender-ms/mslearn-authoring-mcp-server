# Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework

Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework is a set of APIs (methods, events, and protocols) that enables developers and partners to build immersive communication experiences so that third-party communication widgets running on a channel provider or partner cloud can interact with Dynamics 365.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework

Don't use *Channel Integration Framework.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
