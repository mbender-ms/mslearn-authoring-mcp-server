# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is a mixed-reality solution that empowers technicians with heads-up, hands-free video calling, so they can collaborate with remote experts on a PC or mobile device to troubleshoot issues in context. Dynamics 365 Remote Assist was released for general availability in October 2018 for HoloLens, October 2019 for mobile (Android and iOS), and November 2019 for HoloLens 2.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Remote Assist  

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
