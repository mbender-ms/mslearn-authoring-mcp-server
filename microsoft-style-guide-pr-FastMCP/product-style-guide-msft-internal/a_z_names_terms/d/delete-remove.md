# delete, remove

*Delete* and *remove* are often used interchangeably, but *delete* is preferred for more permanent or consequential removals, such as deleting contacts from multiple sources, whereas *remove* is preferred for less destructive actions such as:

- Physically taking something out of a device (for example, a battery).
- Uninstalling an app or taking data off the device or Windows.
- Taking info off a list.
- Removing an object from a group or location.

When you're referring to people (or contacts or users) in a list, avoid using *delete,* and substitute *remove.*
