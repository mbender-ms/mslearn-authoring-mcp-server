# device

- When possible, avoid this term and use a more specific word or write around it.
- When used to describe a group of devices, follow up with a few examples. Examples of devices include laptops, PCs, cameras, disk drives, printers, mice, game controllers, and modems.
- If you must refer to multiple form factors and can't be more specific, *device* is the preferred term.
- When deciding what to call a specific hardware device, go through the following questions until the answer is yes:

| Question to ask | Term to use |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Does it fit in your back pocket and run something other than the full Windows OS? | If you can make telephone calls with it, it’s a phone (we used to call these mobile phones, but due to ubiquity, let’s just say *phone* now). If you can’t, it’s a *mobile device*. All mobile phones are mobile devices, but not all mobile devices are phones. |
| Is it too big to fit in your pocket? | It's a *computer.* |
| Are you working on something technology-specific that requires you to describe the hardware and add the complicating information of a particular form factor? | Then ... |
| Does it run the full version of Windows? | It’s a *PC,* but if form factor is important, call it a *desktop* or a *laptop* (see below). |
| Does it run the Mac operating system? | It's a *Mac.* |
| Does it have a screen that's touch-sensitive? | If it lacks an integrated keyboard, it’s a *tablet.* And this is usually the term you’ll use. But, if you need to split hairs … if it has an integrated keyboard and a screen that can be flipped around so that the PC is sometimes shaped like a laptop but can also be held like a tablet, it’s a *convertible tablet.* If it’s about the size of a trade paperback and may or may not have integrated keys, it might be an *ultramobile PC (UMPC)* or a *phablet.* |
| Can you carry it around easily for computing on the go? | It's a *laptop,* unless *notebook* is part of its hardware name. |
| Do you need to refer to its proprietary name? | If it runs the Android operating system, it’s an *Android phone, Android tablet,* or (nonspecifically) an *Android device.* If it runs iOS and it’s a phone, it’s an *iPhone;* the larger device is *iPad.* Windows phone hardware is *Windows Phone.* |
| Is it designed to stay in one place? | It's a *desktop.* |

**Example**  
When you connect a device, such as a printer, mouse, or keyboard, Windows automatically tries to install the correct driver for your device.
