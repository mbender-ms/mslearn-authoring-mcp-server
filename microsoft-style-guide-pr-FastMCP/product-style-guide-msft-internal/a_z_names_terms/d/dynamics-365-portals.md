# Dynamics 365 Portals

Dynamics 365 Portals is an extensible framework that customers use to build highly customized and tailored experiences. A great way to allow internal and external audiences to view and interact with Dynamics 365 data, Dynamics 365 Portals can form a key part of an organization's overall web strategy.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Portals

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Portals  

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name.

Use *portal,* lowercase, to refer to the thing created using Dynamics 365 Portals.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
