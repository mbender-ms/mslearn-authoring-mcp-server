# Diagnostics, diagnostics

The capability within Azure Cloud Services that enables the collection of diagnostic data on a deployed application.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Diagnostics

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Diagnostics

Lowercase an instance/output of the service or as a generic term: diagnostics
