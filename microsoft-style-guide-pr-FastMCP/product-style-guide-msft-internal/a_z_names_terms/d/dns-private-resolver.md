# DNS Private Resolver

Azure DNS Private Resolver is an Azure service that bridges the customer's on-premises Domain Name System (DNS) with Azure DNS, allowing customers to query DNS zones hosted in Azure DNS from an on-premises environment.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure DNS Private Resolver

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: DNS Private Resolver

In references to Azure DNS Private Resolver, don’t spell out *DNS* as *Domain Name System.*

When you’re referring generically to this type of technology, lowercase *private* and *resolver*—that is, *DNS private resolver.*

Always spell out *Azure DNS Private Resolver;* with the exception of *DNS,* don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
