# digital transformation

Digital transformation is about bringing together people, data, and processes to transform your company and create value for your customers.

Digital transformation is how some organizations describe their efforts to bring new technologies, processes, and culture together with shared purpose. This purpose may be to improve customer experience, innovate faster, or simply survive better as digital disruption reshapes their industry. 

In general, lowercase *digital transformation*—this is an industry term, not a Microsoft initiative.

**Exception**  
Use title-style capitalization when referring to the Microsoft business unit named Digital Transformation Platform Group.
