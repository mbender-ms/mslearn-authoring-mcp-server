# DevOps Projects

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure DevOps Projects

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: DevOps Projects

Lowercase when referring to a single instance/output of using the service: project 

Avoid repeating the word *project(s)*, such as *DevOps Projects project*. Use "your project in DevOps Projects" or similar.

Note that DevOps Projects and Azure DevOps are different services. Don't confuse the service name *DevOps Projects*, where *Projects* is always plural and capitalized, with a project in Azure DevOps, which is always lowercase *project*.
