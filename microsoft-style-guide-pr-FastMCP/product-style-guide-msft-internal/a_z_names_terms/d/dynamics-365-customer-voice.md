# Dynamics 365 Customer Voice

In July 2020, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice became the new name for the app formerly known as Microsoft Forms Pro.  
If you need to refer to Microsoft Forms Pro in transition or legacy content, see the [Forms Pro](~\a_z_names_terms\f\forms-pro.md) topic. The Microsoft Forms app isn’t changing names and will continue as a Microsoft 365 service.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Customer Voice

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

Don’t use the name *Dynamics 365 Voice of the Customer* or *Voice of the Customer for Dynamics 365.*
