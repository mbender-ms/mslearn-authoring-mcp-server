# de-identify

To take actions on data that prevent it from revealing someone's personal identity. For example, data produced during human subject research might be de-identified to preserve the privacy of research participants.

Don't use *de-identify* and *anonymize* as synonyms. They have distinct meanings with legal implications. Anonymization of personal data is a subcategory of de-identification, wherein direct and indirect personal identifiers are removed and data can never be re-identified.â€‹

Although *de-identify* feels overly technical for general usage, it has a precise legal definition that needs to be preserved in some compliance scenarios. Consult with CELA when using.
