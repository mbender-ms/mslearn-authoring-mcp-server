# Dynamics 365 (online)

In the past, the term *Dynamics 365 (online)* was used in documentation to refer collectively to Dynamics 365 for Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, Project Service Automation, and related services (the apps also sometimes referred to as *customer engagement apps*).

However, this usage is no longer correct. In current documentation, don't use *Dynamics 365 (online)* and instead refer to the individual apps by name whenever possible.
