# Dynamics 365 Contact Center

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a contact center as a service (CCaaS) product powered by AI.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word Microsoft has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Contact Center  

Branded, title-cased, never localize.  

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365*.
