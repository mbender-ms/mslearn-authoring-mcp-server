# detect vs. find

Although using these terms—and their variants like *detected, detection,* and *finding*—in reference to computers is anthropomorphic, they are OK to use as appropriate. This particularly true in UI labels for AI apps and explanations of what the AI does.

Note that there's a slight difference in meaning between *detect* and *find:* they both imply effort, but *find* is more general, whereas *detect* connotes that the thing being found was hidden or not readily apparent.

Voice is another consideration. *Detect* can sound robotic and technical, so consider using *find* or a similar word like *locate* unless it's necessary to convey the aspect of finding something hidden or subtle.

**Examples**

[From the discontinued product Dynamics 365 Market Insights]:

(UI label) The detected change in web traffic  
 
Detect gradual or sharp changes in website traffic volume.  
 
Top Communities will show if at least one community was detected.
