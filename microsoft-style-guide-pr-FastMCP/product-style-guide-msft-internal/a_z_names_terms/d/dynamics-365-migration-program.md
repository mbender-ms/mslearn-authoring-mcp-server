First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Migration Program

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Migration Program 

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

Include *the* in references to the Dynamics 365 Migration Program in running text.
