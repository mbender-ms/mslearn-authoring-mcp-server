# dark mode

In all apps, use *dark mode*Â to refer to the setting that changes the default bright background color to a darker color, which is easier on the eyes in low-light environments or for people who prefer interfaces that aren't as bright.

Lowercase and two words.

**Examples**  
Use dark mode everywhere.  
Dark mode now works in notifications.  
To turn on dark mode, select **Settings** > **Personalization**, and choose **Dark mode**.  
Toggle **dark mode** on or off.
