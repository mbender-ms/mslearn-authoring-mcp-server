# Developer Portal

When referring to the Azure web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools, **don't use**. Use [the Azure portal](~\a_z_names_terms\p\portal.md) instead.

When referring to Microsoft Teams, the Developer Portal is a dedicated app management console for developers, via web or client, where they can register, configure, collaborate, design, manage, and monitor their Teams apps in a central location.
