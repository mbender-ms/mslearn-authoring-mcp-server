# dashboard

UI component. The term *dashboard* in UI refers to a one-screen summary of key data, monitoring, or tracking information, such as within Power BI, Dynamics 365 apps, or the Microsoft Azure portal.

- Avoid talking about dashboards. Instead, try to discuss what the customer needs to do or what they're looking at.
- Don't include the word *dashboard* in UI labels.  
  **Example** Marketing insights (not *Marketing insights dashboard* in a UI label)
- Always name the dashboard except in general references to a dashboard or dashboards.
- Use sentence-style capitalization for the dashboard name.  
  **Example** Projected sales
- In a dashboard title or subtitle, use a plus sign (+) instead of *and* or an ampersand (&). Include a space on either side of the plus sign.
- Add an article, such as *a* or *the*, to a dashboard name that consists of a verb and a singular noun.  
  **Example** On the Social posts + sentiment dashboard, â€¦
- Use *on* to describe the contents of a dashboard.  
  **Example** On the Marketing campaign dashboard, give your campaign a name.
- Use *open* and *close* as verbs with dashboards.
