# Dynamics 365 Layout

Dynamics 365 Layout is no longer available to new customers. Current customers will be able to use it until December 31, 2021, or the end of their subscription, whichever is earlier. A set of core Dynamics 365 Layout capabilities will be integrated into Dynamics 365 Guides in future releases.

If you need to refer to the discontinued product in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Layout

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365 Layout  

Always include *Dynamics 365* in the name. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
