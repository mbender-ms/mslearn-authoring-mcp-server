# toggle

Use as a noun or an adjective (as in *toggle key*).

Don't use as a verb. Instead, use *switch, turn on,* or *turn off* with the name of the toggle key or command to describe what the customer needs to do.

**Examples**  
Select **Settings** [glyph] > **Ease of Access** [glyph] > **Narrator**, and then use the toggle to turn on Narrator quick launch.  
Use the **Caps lock** key to switch from typing capital letters to typing lowercase letters.  
To switch between Normal, Outline, and Slide Sorter views, use the buttons on the **View** tab.  
To make text and apps easier to see, turn on the toggle under **Turn on high contrast**.  
To keep all applied filters, turn on the **Pass all filters** toggle.
