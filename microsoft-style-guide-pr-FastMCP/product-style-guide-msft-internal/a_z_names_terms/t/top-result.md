# top result

The search result that's most relevant to a customer and that includes consolidated actions and content from multiple sources.

- Use this phrase to refer to the largest and most prominent result when a customer searches in Windows.
- This isn't a named entity that needs special attention; it's just the result that's most relevant to the search query.
- Avoid *best* or *primary* to describe the result.

**Example**  
When you search for an artist, you can see extra info and play the artist's music directly from the top result.
