# tenant

An account for an organization that has its data stored separately from that of other organizations but which is accessed through a shared service. In reference to Azure Active Directory, *tenant* is an instance of Azure AD that's automatically created when an organization signs up for a subscription to a Microsoft cloud-based service like Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, or Dynamics 365.

**Guidelines**  

Avoid using *tenant* except when talking to an enterprise or admin audience. Use *org*, *organization*, *your organization*, or *your organization's account* instead.  
It's OK to use when you must be specific, such as when you're referring to multitenant organizations or a tenant ID, or in the context of PowerShell commandlets that use tenant.
