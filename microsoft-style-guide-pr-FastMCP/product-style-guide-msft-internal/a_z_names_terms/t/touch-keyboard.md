# touch keyboard

A representation of a keyboard that appears on the screen and lets people "type" by using touch or a mouse. Don't confuse this with the accessibility feature named *On-Screen Keyboard.* 

- Don't refer to it as an *on-screen keyboard* (in a general reference) or as *the On-Screen Keyboard* (which is an accessibility-optimized feature of Windows).
- Don't use *soft keyboard.* 
- In Windows, use *touch keyboard* if you need to clarify that you're not referring to a physical keyboard, the thumb keyboard, or the On-Screen Keyboard. If there's no ambiguity, shorten to *keyboard,* the preferred term.
