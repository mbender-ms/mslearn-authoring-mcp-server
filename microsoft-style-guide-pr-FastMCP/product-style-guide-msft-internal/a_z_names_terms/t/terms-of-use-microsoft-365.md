# Terms of Use (Microsoft 365)

Use *Terms of Use* to refer to the explanation of terms posted on the Microsoft website: [Microsoft Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/terms-of-use)

Use title-style capitalization.

Don’t use *TOU.*

Don’t use *Terms of Use* when you mean the Microsoft Services Agreement. The Terms of Use and the Microsoft Services Agreement are different things.
