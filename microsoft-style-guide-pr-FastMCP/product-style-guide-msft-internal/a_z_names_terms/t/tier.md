# tier

Applied to pricing, service, or performance plans, a *tier* is the level that determines which features or how much functionality the customer gets and how much they pay for the plan.

**Guidelines**

Use title-style capitalization for the name, but lowercase the word *tier.*

Don’t refer to the tier name alone unless the context is clear. Include *the* and *tier* as needed to clarify that you’re referring to a tier name.

Also lowercase phrases that include *tier,* such as *pricing tier, service tier,* and *performance tier.*

**Our style**  
You can create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server in one of three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized.  
Service tier options include General Purpose, Business Critical, and Hyperscale.  
The Business Critical service tier is best used for applications requiring high transaction rate, low IO latency, and high IO throughput. This service tier offers the highest resilience to failures.
