# Test Manager extension

An access level for buying a license to use Azure Test Plans inside Azure DevOps.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Test Manager extension
- Subsequent mentions: extension
- Donâ€™t say *Azure Test Manager* or *Azure Test Manager extension*. This is not really software but an access level for a license. Just refer to it as the *Test Manager extension for Azure Test Plans*.
- This is not the same as *Microsoft Test Manager*, which is a client tool for Windows machines that customers can use to connect to an instance of Azure DevOps.
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
