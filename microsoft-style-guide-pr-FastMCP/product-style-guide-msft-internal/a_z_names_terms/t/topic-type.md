# topic type

In Microsoft Viva, these are topics that have traits in common or characteristics that distinguish them as a group or class.

Lowercase.

On the first mention, use *topic type.* On subsequent mentions and when the context makes it clear that you're talking about topics, it might be OK to use just *type.*
