# the (when to include in names)

In general, when a product, service, or feature name appears by itself (as a noun), don’t precede the name with *the.* But if the name functions as an adjective, the name can be preceded by *the.* For example, we say, “Windows is an operating system,” not “The Windows is an operating system.” That’s because “Windows” appears by itself (as a noun) in this case. But we say, “The Windows upgrade installed quickly” because “Windows” functions as an adjective modifying “upgrade.”
