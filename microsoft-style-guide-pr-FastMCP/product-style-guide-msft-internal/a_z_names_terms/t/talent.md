# Talent

The functionality in Dynamics 365 Talent: Core HR became part of Dynamics 365 Human Resources in the February 2020 release. For details, see [Human Resources](~\a_z_names_terms\h\human-resources.md).  

Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract and Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard are being retired. Learn more at [Retiring Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract and Onboard apps](https://community.dynamics.com/365/talent/b/dynamics365fortalent/posts/retiring-dynamics-365-talent-attract-and-onboard-apps).  
If you need to refer to Dynamics 365 Talent, Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract, or Dynamics 365 Talent: Onboard in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Talent

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Talent.”

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

**Our style**  
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent automates a number of processes related to staffing. Dynamics 365 Talent streamlines employee retention, benefits administration, training, performance reviews, and change management. Talent also provides a framework for human resources staff to manage areas of oversight.
