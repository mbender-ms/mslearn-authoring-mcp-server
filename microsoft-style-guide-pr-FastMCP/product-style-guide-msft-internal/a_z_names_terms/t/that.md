# that

*That* introduces a restrictive clause, which is a clause that’s essential for the sentence to make sense. A restrictive clause often defines the noun or phrase preceding it and isn’t separated from the noun or phrase by a comma.

**Guidelines**

Don’t use *that* to refer to a person. Use *who* instead.

**Example**

You’ll need to supply information about the applications that you’re developing and submitting to the Azure Store.
