# text box

The name for the editable box that the user enters text into.  
Refer to a box in which the user enters text only by its label. If you must use a descriptor, use just *box.* Don't use *field* or *entry field,* except in content about database programs.

**Examples**  
Type the person's name in the **To** box.  
**File name** box   
Enter or update an email address for **Work email**.

In content for developers, it's OK to use *text box* in content about designing and developing the UI.
