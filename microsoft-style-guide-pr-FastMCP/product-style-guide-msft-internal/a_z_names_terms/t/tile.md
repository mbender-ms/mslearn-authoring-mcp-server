# tile

Tiles refer to the square and rectangular UI components.

**Guidelines**

Use lowercase, even in references to specific, named tiles.

**Example**

Pin the things that matter most, resize tiles to show more or less data, and drill in for all the details.

Note: In Azure, the term *tile* replaced *part*.
