# threat actor

A *thread actor* is an individual or group responsible for cyberthreats.

Use only in content for security specialist audiences.

Use *threat actor* instead of *bad actor, malicious actor,* or *malicious user.* If you're referring to individuals or groups that are directly running an attack, you can use *threat actor* interchangeably with *attacker.*

For named groups, the preferred term is *activity group.*
