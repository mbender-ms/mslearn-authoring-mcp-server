# Traffic Collector

Azure Traffic Collector is an Azure networking service that collects traffic from various gateways, processes traffic based on various policies, and forwards raw or processed traffic to other Azure monitoring, visualization, and security tools such as Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Traffic Collector

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Traffic Collector

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
