# Team Foundation Server

Team Foundation Server is the previous name for [Azure DevOps Server](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-devops-server.md). *Team Foundation Server* should be used only for previous versions.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Team Foundation Server

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
