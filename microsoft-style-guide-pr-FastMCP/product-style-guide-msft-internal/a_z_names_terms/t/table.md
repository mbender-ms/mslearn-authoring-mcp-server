# table

The meaning of the term _table_ varies in different products. Use the term appropriately in your context.

**Azure Table Storage**

In Azure Table Storage, a table represents a collection of entities. Entities are similar to rows. An entity has a partition, a primary key, and a set of properties.

**Microsoft Dataverse and Dataverse for Teams**

A table, comprising columns and rows, represents a set of data stored in Dataverse. Customers of Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Virtual Agents (including the integration of those apps in Microsoft Teams) build apps, flows, reports, and bots using _tables_. In the UI, how you refer to an element of a table depends on the context. See the example below for a table called _Account_.
