# telemetry

Telemetry refers to the automated collection and transmission of system or product usage information, performance metrics, and diagnostic signals from software, devices, or services.

**Guidelines**

- Avoid using *telemetry* as a catch-all for any kind of data or analytics. Use more specific or user-friendly terms such as:

    - diagnostic data
    - usage data
    - performance metrics

- Telemetry is considered **personal data** under Microsoftâ€™s data classification policies and must be handled accordingly. Whether you're using the term telemetry or an alternative term in UI or customer-facing content, you should have the content reviewed by CELA and/or the privacy team.
