# third-party

â€‹Use *partner* or *non-Microsoft* instead of *third-party* to refer to a company that manufactures and sells accessories or peripherals for use with another company's computers or peripherals.

For clarity, don't use *first-party and third-party services.* Instead, refer to *services from Microsoft and others.*
