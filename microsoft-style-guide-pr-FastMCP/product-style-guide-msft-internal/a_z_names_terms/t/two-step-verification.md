# two-step verification

An optional Microsoft account sign-in method. When users turn on two-step verification, they have to enter both a password and a security code that's sent to them by the Microsoft account team.

Note the hyphen.

Don't use *two-step authorization* or *two-step authentication.*

Avoid using the term *multifactor authentication* in consumer-facing content.

**Example**  
Two-step verification makes it harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your Microsoft account.â€¯
