# recycle bin

A recycle bin is a temporary storage location where deleted files can be stored before either being restored or permanently deleted.

**Guidelines**

*Recycle bin* is a noun phrase and is lowercase in most uses.  
To prevent confusion between the Windows, SharePoint, OneDrive, consider mentioning the product name to clarify which recycle bin you mean.  
In product UI, the capitalization for the label shown on the recycle bin itself varies (*Recycle Bin* in Windows UI; sentence-cased *Recycle bin* in most other products).  
Use lowercase *recycle bin* in most writing, unless instructing the user to interact directly with the recycle bin that they see on the screen. In that case, bold the name of the UI element they need to interact with, and follow the capitalization shown in the product UI.  

**Examples**  

Do you want to permanently delete these items from the recycle bin?  

You can recover deleted items from the Windows recycle bin.  

In OneDrive, select **Recycle bin**, and then select **Empty**.
