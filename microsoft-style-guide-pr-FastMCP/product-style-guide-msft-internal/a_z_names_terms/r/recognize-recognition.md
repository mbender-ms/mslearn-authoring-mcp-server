# recognize, recognition

In content for makers and analysts, it’s OK to use *recognition* in the AI sense—in particular, in compound terms that include the word *recognition*—as needed without defining the terms.

A number of *recognition* terms are in common use, so before you create a new one, make sure a term doesn't already exist that fits your meaning.

In content for end users, avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

It's OK to use *recognize* in explanations of how an AI app works.

**Note:** This guidance will need to be reassessed periodically. Over time, AI terminology could become more familiar to a general audience, and there might be no problem with referring to terms for recognition technologies.

**Examples**

The text recognition prebuilt model is available in Power Apps and Power Automate.

Use the Ink Recognizer API to give your apps the ability to recognize handwritten content.
