# role-based access control (RBAC)

Lowercase, and note the hyphen in *role-based.*

It's OK to use *role-based access control* to describe the type of access control being referenced (as opposed to *attribute-based access control*). 

Avoid the acronym in most cases. Instead, describe the functionality—for example, "your account needs to have these permissions." Or, instead of using *an RBAC role,* refer to the name of the role.

If you use the acronym, spell it out on the first use. 

And there are multiple RBAC systems, which can be confusing to users. So if you use the term, *always precede it with* Azure *or another modifier;* don't use *RBAC* by itself. ​

**Examples**  
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)  
Service Fabric RBAC  
Turn on Kubernetes RBAC
