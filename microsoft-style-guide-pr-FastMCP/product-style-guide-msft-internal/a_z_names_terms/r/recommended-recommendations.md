# recommended, recommendations

Don't use *recommended* or *recommendations* to characterize AI output, either as a UI label or in other text. It may be overstating and therefore misleading. Instead use *Suggested* or one of these options:

- Highlighted
- Checked
- Prioritized
- Ranked
- Predicted
- Identified
- Found
- Related to
- Important
- Ideas
- Likely or Most likely
- Typically
- Potential
- Consider
- Might/could

**Note:** Don't use *may,* which can sound like we're giving the user permission. (See [can, may](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/c/can-may) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*.)
