# release plan

Use *release plan,* not *release notes,* to refer to the [information published on the Docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/) about the planned feature and app releases of the Digital Transformation Platform Group.

Each set of release plans covers a six-month period, either from April to September or from October to March. Each release plan is made available [online on the Docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/) and also as a PDF document, which can be used at conferences and left with customers at sales meetings to give them reliable data they can use to plan for using our products.

Learn more about how we create release notes in our [BACX Contributors Guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/bacx/rn-guide?branch=master).

In Azure, the latest information about Azure products, features, and functionality is published on the [Azure updates page](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/).
