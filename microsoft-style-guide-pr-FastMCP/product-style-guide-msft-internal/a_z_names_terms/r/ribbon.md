# ribbon

A control that improves usability by exposing a program's most frequently accessed features directly to customers. The ribbon makes it easier for people to find and use program features because less-used features are hidden.

In procedures, avoid referring to the ribbon. Instead, use the wording found in Office documentation, which refers to specific tabs, groups, and commands.

In general information, such as when explaining what the ribbon is, call it *the ribbon.*

On the **Page Layout** tab, in the **Themes** group, select **Theme Colors**.â€¯
