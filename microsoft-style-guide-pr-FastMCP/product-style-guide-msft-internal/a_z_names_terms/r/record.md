# record

A *record* is an individual item that contains a specific type of information, usually represented in the UI as a form. In Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service, the data from each record is stored as a *row* in a *table* in a Microsoft Dataverse database, and the *values* from each *field* are stored in the corresponding *column.*

In content for business users (including managers):

- Avoid using the term *record* if it’s possible to be more specific. For example, say, "Choose an account" rather than "Choose a record."
- When it’s not possible to be more specific, it’s OK to use the term *record.*
- When referring to categories of records, such as in grid headings, use *types of records* or *record types.*

In content for admins/makers, use the term—*record* or a more specific term—that makes the most sense for your audience.
