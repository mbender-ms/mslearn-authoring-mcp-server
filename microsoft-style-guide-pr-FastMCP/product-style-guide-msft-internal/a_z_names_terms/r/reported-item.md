# reported item

In Microsoft 365 security products, a *reported item* is part of a submission.Â A reported item can be a file, an email, or another object. If you know what the item is, replace *item* with the type (for example, *file*).

Use *submission* to refer to the item and accompanying metadata that was sent to Microsoft.
