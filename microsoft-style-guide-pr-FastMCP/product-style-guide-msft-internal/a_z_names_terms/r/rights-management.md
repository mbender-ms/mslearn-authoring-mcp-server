# Rights Management

Azure Rights Management uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure files and email. It is a data protection solution that works across multiple devices—phones, tablets, and PCs—to protect information inside and outside an organization.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Rights Management
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Azure RMS
