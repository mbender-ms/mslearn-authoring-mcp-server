# region

In Azure region taxonomy, a region is an area within a geo, without any implication of hierarchy or nesting within a geo. If necessary, a region can be assigned to a different geo in the future.

**Guidelines**

- Don't use _subregion_; use _region_ instead.
- When referring to countries or regions in general, nontechnical contexts, use _country/region_.
- Don't capitalize _region_.
