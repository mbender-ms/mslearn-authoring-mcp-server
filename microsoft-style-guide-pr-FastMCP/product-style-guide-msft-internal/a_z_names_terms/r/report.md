# report

A written account of a topic, feature, or state that includes textual and/or visual elements. In Power BI content, a *report* provides multiple perspectives into a single dataset, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights from that dataset.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase.
- Different from *digest*.
