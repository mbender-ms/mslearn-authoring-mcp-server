# roam

Do not use roam (or its derivatives) in reference to two devices, locations, and/or apps, etc., syncing information. 

Use instead: 

- sync across (devices, locations, apps, etc.)
- apply across (devices, locations, apps, etc.)
- will sync (as in “these settings will sync”)
- will be applied

**Example**: The settings you choose here will sync across all devices and apps you sign into.

**See also** [sync, synchronize](~\a_z_names_terms\s\sync-synchronize.md)
