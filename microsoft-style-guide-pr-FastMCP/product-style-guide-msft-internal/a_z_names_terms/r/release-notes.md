# release notes

Don’t use *release notes* to refer to the [information published on the Docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/) about the planned feature and app releases of the Digital Transformation Platform Group. Use *release plan* instead.

In Azure, release notes are published only for products that are delivered as software or as an SDK. For example, Azure Storage Explorer, StorSimple, and SDKs are delivered as static, versioned products. Products that are delivered to customers as services aren’t usually versioned and therefore shouldn’t have release notes. The information you would have traditionally included in the release notes accompanying a new release should just be included in the relevant technical content or in the [Azure updates channel](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/).
