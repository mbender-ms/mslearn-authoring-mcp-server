# recommend

Use *recommended* or *we recommend* to introduce a recommendation, but only when you also describe the benefits of that choice. When it might be ambiguous who is recommending an action, be specific (for example, "OneDrive recommends" or "Windows recommends"). Avoid the passive voice *itâ€™s recommended*, as this sounds corporate and evasive.  

In a wizard or settings experience, use *recommended* on the label for an option that we recommend for most customers, along with a description of the benefits of that choice.  

Don't use *recommended* or *recommendation* to characterize AI output. It may be overstating and therefore misleading. Replace with terms such as *suggested*, *likely*, *related*, or *consider*. For more information about the use of recommend or recommendations in an AI context, see [recommend, recommendations](~\a_z_names_terms\r\recommended-recommendations.md).  

**Examples**  
We recommend that you move to a Windows 11 PC to continue to receive security updates from Microsoft.  

The recommended files list allows you to quickly access files with notable activity such as edits, mentions, and comments by people you interact with.
