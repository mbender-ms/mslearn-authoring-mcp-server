# row-level security, RLS

Power BI feature that enables customers to control access to rows in a database table based on the characteristics of the user executing a query (for example, group membership). Row-level security is being implemented for datasets in the service for customers who don't use the tabular model (they use SQL or cloud-based security).

You can configure RLS for data models imported into Power BI with Power BI Desktop. You can also configure RLS on datasets that are using DirectQuery, such as SQL Server.

Always hyphenate *row-level* in *row-level security.* It's OK to use the abbreviation *RLS* on subsequent mentions after the full name has been spelled out.

Don't use *role-level security.*
