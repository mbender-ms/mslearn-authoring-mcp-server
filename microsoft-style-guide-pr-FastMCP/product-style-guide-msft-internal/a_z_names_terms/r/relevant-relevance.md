# relevant, relevance

Don't use except when you're talking specifically about the relevance of search results.

Don't use *relevant* to try to characterize the relevance of AI-generated output to the userâ€”it's presumptuous. And if the relevance score is low, the customer might wonder why the output is being offered as a suggestion or insight and view the app's AI as unreliable in general.
