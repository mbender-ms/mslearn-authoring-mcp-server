# Field Service

The Dynamics 365 Field Service app helps companies deliver onsite service to customer locations. It combines workflow automation, scheduling algorithms, and mobility to set mobile workers up for success when they're onsite with customers fixing issues.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Field Service

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Field Service.”

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

**Our style**  

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service helps you optimize your service schedule. Use Dynamics 365 Field Service for efficient routing and reduced travel time. For example, you can configure resource information to allow Field Service to efficiently match the best field agent to a work order.
