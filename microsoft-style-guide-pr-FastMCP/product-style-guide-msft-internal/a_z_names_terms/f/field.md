# field

In forms, the space where a person enters or edits information is called a _field._

In tables, _fields_ hold individual and calculated values of a column.

In content for business users (including managers) of apps in the Digital Transformation Platform Group:

- Avoid using the term _field_ if it’s possible to be more specific. 
- When it’s not possible to be more specific, it’s OK to use the term _field._ 
- Don’t use the following terms to refer to a field: 
  - column
  - attribute

**Our style**  
Enter a phone number

**Not our style**  
Phone number field must be filled in

In content for admins/makers, use the term that makes the most sense for your audience.
