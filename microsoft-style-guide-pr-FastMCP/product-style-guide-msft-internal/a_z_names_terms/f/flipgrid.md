# Flipgrid

Flipgrid is an app that allows users to record and view videos and receive notifications when videos and topics are created in an integrated Microsoft Teams Grid.  

**Guidelines**

All mentions: Flipgrid

One word. Don’t capitalize the *g*—that is, don’t use *FlipGrid.*

Note: Flipgrid was acquired by Microsoft. In third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isn’t present, we attribute it to Microsoft by saying “Flipgrid, by Microsoft.”
