# Field Service (on-premises)

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service (on-premises)

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, and the context makes it clear that you're talking about the on-premises deployment, you can use the app name alone:

Field Service

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Field Service (on-premises).”

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
