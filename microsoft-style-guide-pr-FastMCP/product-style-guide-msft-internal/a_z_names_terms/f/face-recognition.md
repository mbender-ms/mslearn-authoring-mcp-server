# face recognition

In content for makers and analysts, it's OK to use *face recognition* as needed without defining the term. In content for end users, avoid focusing on the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it. Don’t use *facial recognition.*

**Notes:**

- If you’re creating marketing content for a government audience on the subject of face recognition, run your proposed content through the [Government Content Review Process](https://aka.ms/GovReviewProcess). If you have questions about this process, contact [govtrev@microsoft.com](mailto:govtrev@microsoft.com).
- If you’re working on an app that includes face recognition capability, be sure to review the [transparency note published by the Office of Responsible AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/transparency-note-azure-cognitive-services-face-api/) and especially the [six principles to guide Microsoft’s facial recognition work](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/17/six-principles-to-guide-microsofts-facial-recognition-work/).
