# focus

A Windows 11 feature (in the Clock app and elsewhere) that allows users to choose which notifications they would like to see and hear so they can stay focused. The remaining notifications will go to Quick settings and can be viewed any time.  

**Guidelines**  

- Lowercase  
- Localize as a descriptive term.  

**Note**: This is not a rename of *focus assist*, but a separate feature for Windows 11 SV2.
