# Forms Pro

In July 2020, Microsoft Forms Pro was renamed to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. For guidelines, see [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](~\a_z_names_terms\d\dynamics-365-customer-voice.md).  
The Microsoft Forms app isn’t changing names and will continue as a Microsoft 365 service.  
When you need to refer to Microsoft Forms Pro in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Forms Pro

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the product name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Forms Pro

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
