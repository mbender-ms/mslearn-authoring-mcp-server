# Functions

Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Functions

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Functions, Functions

Use *Azure Functions* as necessary to distinguish it as an Azure service. It's OK to use just *Functions* when the context makes it clear you're referring to the Azure service.

To refer to something built using Functions or in a generic reference, use lowercase *function app*.
