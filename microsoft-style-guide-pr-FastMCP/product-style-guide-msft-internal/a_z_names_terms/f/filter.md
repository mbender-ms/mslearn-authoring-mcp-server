# filter

Use as a noun to mean a set of conditions that hold back elements or modify the appearance of an existing list or data set in order to view a specific subset of the data. Use as a verb to refer to the action of holding back elements or modifying the appearance of an existing list or data set in this manner.

In content for the accidental admin, use *filter* instead of *query* because it's less intimidating. When you use *filter* as a noun, it helps to use a clarifying verb, as in "Apply filter."

In content for an advanced audience or when the subject is advanced queries, use *query* instead.
