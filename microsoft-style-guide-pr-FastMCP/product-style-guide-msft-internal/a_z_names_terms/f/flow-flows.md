# flow, flows

A *flow* is what you create using Microsoft Power Automate, a product that customers use to automate repetitive tasks. With Power Automate, you can make desktop flows, cloud flows, and business process flows. [Learn more](https://flow.microsoft.com/)

**Guidelines**

- Singular when referring to a single flow, plural when it’s more than one flow.
- Lowercase unless it’s the first word in a sentence or UI label.
- Use *Microsoft Power Automate* to refer to the product itself.
