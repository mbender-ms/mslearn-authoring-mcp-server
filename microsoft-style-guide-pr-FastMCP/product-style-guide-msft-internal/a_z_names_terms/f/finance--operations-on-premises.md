# Finance + Operations (on-premises)

See [Finance](~\a_z_names_terms\f\finance.md) and [Supply Chain Management](~\a_z_names_terms\s\supply-chain-management.md) for guidelines for the app formerly known as Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations.

Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises) unifies global financials and operations to help businesses adapt quickly to changing market demands and drive rapid business growth. On-premises deployments of Finance + Operations aren’t supported on any public cloud infrastructure, including Azure.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises)

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, and the context makes it clear that you're talking about the on-premises deployment, you can use the app name alone:

Finance + Operations

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Finance + Operations (on-premises).”

Use the plus sign (+) instead of spelling out *and* or using the ampersand (&). This aligns the Finance + Operations name with the rest of the Cloud +AI product portfolio. There should be a space on either side of the plus sign (+).

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
