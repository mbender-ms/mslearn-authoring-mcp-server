# feature

A set of software functionality that's designed to solve a specific problem or provide a new functionality to the user.

​​​Avoid using the word feature if you can directly describe what the user can do instead, or what the feature can do for the user.

**Exceptions**

In Windows UI relating to turning a feature on or off, it's OK to use feature. And it's OK to use feature as a collective descriptor for a list of multiple features. But when you're talking about individual features, use the feature name, and describe what it does or what the user can do with it.

Note the difference between a capability and a feature: A capability is a generic functionality that may be common across similar software products in a category, such as a firewall capability or chat capability. A feature is a set of capabilities that are implemented together in a specific way to solve a customer problem. Every company might offer the same capability, but Microsoft products have unique features.

Capabilities are generic, and never capitalized. Feature names are usually lowercase, too, but there are exceptions. Check the [A–Z names and terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) for guidelines for specific feature names.

**Do**

**Using the term *feature* within product UI in Digital Transformation Platform Group**

In UI for Digital Transformation Platform Group products, it's OK to use the AI meaning of *feature* as needed without defining the term in content for makers and analysts. (Within the context of AI, *feature* refers to a category of data used by a machine-learning model—for example, age or salary.)

In content for end users, avoid AI technical terms like *feature.* Instead, focus on the user's intent and the steps they need to take to accomplish their task.

**Examples**  

Ensure that the columns you provide as input are potential features.  
If you know there are columns that would make bad features, you can remove them from the column selection.

For information about naming features, see [Naming](~\naming\naming.md).
