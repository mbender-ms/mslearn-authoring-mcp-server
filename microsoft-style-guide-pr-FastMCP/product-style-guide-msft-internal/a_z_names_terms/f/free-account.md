# free account

On Azure.com, use *free account* instead of *free trial* whenever possible to encourage people to sign up for Azure.  

*Free trial* may be correct for other products, like Visual Studio, or when specifying a limitation, such as 30 days.  

**Our style**  
If you don’t already have an Azure subscription, you can create a free account.  
Your account has to be a paid account, or it has to be within the free trial period you selected when you created your free account. (specifying a limitation)  
Download a free trial version of Visual Studio.  

**Not our style**  
If you don’t already have an Azure subscription, you can start a free trial.  
Your account has to be either a paid account or a free account. (specifying a limitation)  
Start your free trial of Azure today.
