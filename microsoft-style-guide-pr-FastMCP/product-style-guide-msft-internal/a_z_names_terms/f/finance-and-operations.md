# finance and operations

For information about the on-premises app named Finance + Operations, see the [Finance + Operations (on-premises)](~\a_z_names_terms\f\finance--operations-on-premises.md) topic.

## _Finance and operations_ collective term

Whenever possible, refer to a specific app. However, when it’s necessary to refer collectively to the category of apps that includes Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, and Human Resources, it’s OK to use _finance and operations._

In technical content like documentation and release plans, it’s OK to add the qualifier _cross-app_ when you need to refer to functionality that applies to all apps in the finance and operations category.

The collective term is acceptable even after the app name change that went into effect October 1, 2019.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase _finance and operations._
- Avoid wording that makes it sound like _finance and operations_ is a product name. Specifically, never use "Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations."
- Don’t call this a _platform_—that is, don't say “the finance and operations platform.”
- Spell out _and_ in “finance and operations.” Don’t use an ampersand (&) or plus sign (+).
- Lowercase the qualifier _cross-app_ in the phrase “finance and operations cross-app” to make it clear this isn’t an app name.

## Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations app

- Products that are licensed after October 1, 2019, will use the new names: [Dynamics 365 Finance](~\a_z_names_terms\f\finance.md) and [Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](~\a_z_names_terms\s\supply-chain-management.md).
