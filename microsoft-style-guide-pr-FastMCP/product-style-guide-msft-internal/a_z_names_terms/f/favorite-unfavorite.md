# favorite, unfavorite

In Power BI, use *favorite* as a verb to refer to adding dashboards and reports to the Favorites list. When the customer no longer wants the item on the Favorites list, they *unfavorite* it.

**Note:** This usage is an exception to the [favorite](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/f/favorite) topic in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*.
