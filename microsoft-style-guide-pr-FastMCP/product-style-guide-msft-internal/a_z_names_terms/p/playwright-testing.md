# Playwright Testing

An Azure service designed for developers and testers, Playwright Testing enables end-to-end scenario testing for modern web apps built on the open-source Playwright library. Because it’s cross-portfolio, it’s Microsoft branded, not Azure branded.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Playwright Testing

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface. 
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Playwright Testing

Don’t include *Azure.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation.  For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
