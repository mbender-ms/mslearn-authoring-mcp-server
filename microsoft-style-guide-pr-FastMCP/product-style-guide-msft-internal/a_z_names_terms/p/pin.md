# PIN

Acronym for *personal identification number.* But most of the time, the acronym *PIN* is preferred. Don’t spell out unless you need to define the term.

- Use only when *PIN* is specified in the UI.
- Don't use in place of *password.* Don't use the redundant *PIN number.*
- Don't capitalize as *pin* or *Pin*—always use all caps.

**Examples**  
Use a PIN to lock my SIM card...  
When prompted, enter the PIN for your SIM card.  
If your device is locked, enter your PIN to sign in.
