# premium (Microsoft 365)

When lowercase, premium describes content or features available to a customer who upgrades from one offering to a better or more expensive offering.

**Guidelines**

- Don't capitalize *premium* **except** as part of an approved product name.
- Avoid using *premium* to describe such paid features where *Premium* is part of a related subscription/SKU name, because this implies availability is limited to a specific “Premium” subscription such as Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Power BI Premium, or Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium.

Don’t use *premium* as a category for subscription-based Microsoft 365 apps (in contrast with perpetual Office apps). Replace with more specific phrases, such as:

- Always up to date / limited updates
- Regular feature updates / limited feature updates
- Additional features & latest updates / limited features & updates
- Advanced features and latest updates / limited features and updates
