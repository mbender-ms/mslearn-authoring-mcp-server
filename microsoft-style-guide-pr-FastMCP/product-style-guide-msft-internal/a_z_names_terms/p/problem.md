# problem

Use *problem* instead of *error* or *issue.* A problem is something that's not quite right either because of a service outage or a customer action.

Use *problem* instead of *technical problem*. (Adding technical doesn't add any further information.)

**Guidelines**

In error< messages, be explicit about what happened and tell the customer what to do to fix it or move forward.  
Refer to it as a *message* and not an *error* or *error message*.  
An error message alerts customers of a problem that has already occurred.

**Examples**

There's a problem with the service. Please try again later.  
There's a problem with the password you entered. Check to see if Caps Lock is on.
