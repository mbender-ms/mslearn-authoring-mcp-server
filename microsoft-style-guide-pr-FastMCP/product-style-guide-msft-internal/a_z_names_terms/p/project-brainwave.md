# Project Brainwave

Project Brainwave, Microsoft’s software and hardware for running deep learning computing jobs in the Azure cloud. Brainwave, now available as a preview, is Microsoft’s answer to the custom-built AI chips that companies like Google and Amazon are building to power some of their cloud services. Brainwave uses a type of AI chip, known as a “field-programmable gate array,” (FGPA) that can be reprogrammed for different projects. The main selling point for FGPAs is that they can be upgraded over time to incorporate rapidly evolving AI algorithms, as opposed to conventional chips which can only be programmed once.
