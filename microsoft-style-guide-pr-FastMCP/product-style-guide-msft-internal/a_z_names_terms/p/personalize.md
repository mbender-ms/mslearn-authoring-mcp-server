# personalize

To alter the UI appearance or functions to fit individual preferences.

OK to use *personalize* in UI. Never use *personalize* and *customize* together in the same UI space.

OK to use *customize* where it's appropriate and for more technical, less personal adjustments, such as notification settings and connectivity methods.

**Examples**  
Personalize your desktop to suit your style. Change the color, move things around, and pin your favorite items.  
Here are some of the ways to personalize your computer for ease of use.
