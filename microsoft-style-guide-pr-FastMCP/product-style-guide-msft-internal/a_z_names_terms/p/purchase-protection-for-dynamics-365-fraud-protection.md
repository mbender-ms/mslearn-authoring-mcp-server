# Purchase Protection for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection

**Guidelines**

First mention: Purchase Protection Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Purchase Protection for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, Purchase Protection

Don’t refer to Purchase Protection as an app.

Capitalize *Purchase Protection* only in references to the add-in. In general references, use *purchase protection,* lowercase.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
