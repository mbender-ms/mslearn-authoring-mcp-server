# password

Use _password_ instead of _passkey_ or _passphrase._  

If you're referring specifically to a PIN that a customer has to enter, such as a PIN to unlock a SIM card, use _PIN._  

There may be exceptions to this guideline, depending on the context of the UI. If there's a specific, technical reason for a customer to enter a _passkey_ or _passphrase,_ those phrases are OK to use.
