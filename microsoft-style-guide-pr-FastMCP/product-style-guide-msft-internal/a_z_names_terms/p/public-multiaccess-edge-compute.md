# public multiaccess edge compute

Public multiaccess edge compute is the new name for the Azure Edge Zones with Operator offering. Public multiaccess edge compute enables enterprises to deploy low-latency, high-bandwidth applications through the operators’ public 5G network connectivity.

Lowercase—the public multiaccess edge compute solution isn’t a managed Azure service.

It’s OK to include *Azure,* as in *Azure public multiaccess edge compute,* in marketing and similar messaging text. But if the Azure brand context has been established, don’t include *Azure.*

Note that *multiaccess* is one word, no hyphen.

Always spell out; don't use *MEC* or any other acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
