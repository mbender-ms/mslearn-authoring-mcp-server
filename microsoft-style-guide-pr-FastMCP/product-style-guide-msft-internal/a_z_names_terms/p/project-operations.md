# Project Operations

Dynamics 365 Project Operations is an application that unifies operational workflows to provide the visibility, collaboration, and insights needed to drive success across teams—from sales to finance.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Project Operations
- Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Project Operations.”
- Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
