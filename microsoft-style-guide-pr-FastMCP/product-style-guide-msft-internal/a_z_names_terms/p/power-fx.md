# Power Fx

Power Fx is the low-code language that will be used across Microsoft Power Platform.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Power Fx

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Power Fx

Although it's not required, it's a good idea to repeat the full name *Microsoft Power Fx* occasionally even if the Microsoft brand context is clear or you've already used the full name earlier. We want to clearly distinguish Power Fx as a Microsoft programming language.

Always use the entire phrase *Power Fx.* Don't use *Fx* by itself when referring to the Microsoft Power Fx language.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
