# Power Pages

Power Pages, part of Microsoft Power Platform, is an enterprise-grade, low-code SaaS platform for designing, developing, and launching rich business websites.

Eventually, Power Pages will replace Power Apps portals. At the time of launch, however, customers can either use Power Pages or continue to use Power Apps portals with the ability to opt in to Power Pages.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Power Pages

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Power Pages

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
