# probability

It's OK to use *probability* as either a noun or an adjective as part of an explanation of the AI's output.

**Examples**

[List in a Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management dashboard:]  
Probability of delay in operation  
Probability of scrap  
Probability of overconsumption  

[List in Dynamics 365 Finance for customer payment insights:]  
Probability of payment being made on time  
Probability of payment being made late  
Probability of payment being made very late  

[Explanatory text:] The Binary Prediction model produces as an output a probability that a record will achieve the target outcome. The report includes a slicer for the probability threshold, which influences how the scores above and below the probability threshold are interpreted.

In other, general references, to avoid a technical, formal tone, use friendlier, more everyday words instead, like *likely.*
