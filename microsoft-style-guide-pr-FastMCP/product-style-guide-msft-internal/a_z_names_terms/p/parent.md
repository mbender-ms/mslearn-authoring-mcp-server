# parent

An adult or grown-up person who oversees a child's online activity in Family Safety, usually the primary administrator of the account.

- Our products that address the safety considerations of children on the internet intentionally refer to the adult role as *parent,* whether the grown-up person is technically (biologically or legally) a parent or not. For simplicity, a Family Safety user is either a *parent* or a *child.*
- Don't substitute *guardian* or *adult* to refer to this caretaker role.
- Don't extend phrasing, such as *parent or guardian*—just use *parent.*
- An *adult* or *grown-up person* is considered to be someone 18 or older.
