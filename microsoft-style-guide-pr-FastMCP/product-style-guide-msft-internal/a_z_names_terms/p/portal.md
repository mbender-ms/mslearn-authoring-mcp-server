# portal

A portal is a website or webpage providing access or links to other sites.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase.
- Azure portal:
  - First mention: the Microsoft Azure portal
    - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
      - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the portal name—like on the same screen or surface.
      - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
  - Subsequent mentions: the Azure portal, the portal
- Power Apps:
  - Don't use *portal* to refer to Microsoft Power Apps. Instead, use *Power Apps*, or *make.powerapps.com* if the context requires a URL for clarity.
