# post

Use *post* to refer specifically to uploading a message, photo, link, or similar item to a blog, SharePoint site, or social networking site.

It's OK to use *post* as a noun to refer generically to content that's shared to a website.

**Example**  
You can post messages and pictures to Facebook from your device or comment on other people's posts.
