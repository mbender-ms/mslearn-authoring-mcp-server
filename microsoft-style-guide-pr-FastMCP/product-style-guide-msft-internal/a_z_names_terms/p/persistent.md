# persistent

**Guidelines**

Don't use to describe a virtual machine. From a customer’s perspective, all virtual machines are persistent, so *persistent virtual machine* is redundant.

If necessary, it’s OK to use *persistent* to differentiate the IaaS offer (which has persistent virtual machines) from the PaaS offer (which has stateless virtual machines or role instances).

**See also** [role instance](~\a_z_names_terms\r\role-instance.md)
