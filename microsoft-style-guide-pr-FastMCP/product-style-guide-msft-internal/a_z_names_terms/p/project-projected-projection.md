# project, projected, projection

It's OK to use *project* and its variants in labels and explanations of what the product, such as an AI feature, will do.

The terms *forecast, predict,* and *project* are synonyms with subtle differences in connotation. In general, if any of these terms could be used in a given context, *predict/predicted/prediction* is preferred for voice reasons because it sounds less technical.  

- A prediction is a more general, neutral term. It just means "a guess about what will happen."  
- A forecast is more specific and is a guess with a quantifiable outcome, an estimate. For example, an increase in sales is *predicted,* an increase in sales of 8% is *forecast.* *Forecast* terms tend to be used more in sales apps. 
- A projection is also a prediction, but it's one that takes current or past data and extrapolates from it.

**Note:** Dynamics 365 Sales Insights uses the terms *predictive forecasting* and *forecast projection,* which are redundant. Avoid redundancy when using the terms *predict, project,* and *forecast.* 

**Examples**  

A separate predicted realization line is automatically created to project future revenue over time.

Because these service events can't be predicted, they aren't considered planned maintenance.
