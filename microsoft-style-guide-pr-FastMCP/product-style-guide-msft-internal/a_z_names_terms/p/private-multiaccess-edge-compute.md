# private multiaccess edge compute

Private multiaccess edge compute is the new name for the Azure Private Edge Zone offering. The private multiaccess edge compute solution enables operators and system integrators to integrate computing, networking, and services at the enterprise edge.

Lowercase—the private multiaccess edge compute solution isn’t a managed Azure service.

It’s OK to include *Azure,* as in *Azure private multiaccess edge compute,* in marketing and similar messaging text. But if the Azure brand context has been established, don’t include *Azure.*

Note that *multiaccess* is one word, no hyphen.

Always spell out; don't use *MEC* or any other acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
