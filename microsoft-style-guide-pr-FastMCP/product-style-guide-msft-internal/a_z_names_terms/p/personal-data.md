# personal data

A piece of data containing attributes that can be used to identify an individual personâ€”for example, an email or physical address, a Social Security number, or a bank account number.

OK to use, especially for an admin or end-user audience, as a general term to refer to the types of data that can identify an individual.

Don't use *personally identifiable information* or *PII;* this term is too specific to the United States and is becoming outdated. Use terms like *end-user identifiable information (EUII)* only if you need to refer to a specific data classification.
