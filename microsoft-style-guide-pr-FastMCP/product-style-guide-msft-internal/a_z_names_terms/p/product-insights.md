# Product Insights

As of October 1, 2020, Dynamics 365 Product Insights Preview is now engagement insights (preview), a capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.

For more information about these changes, see the blog post [Announcing new innovations for the Microsoft customer data platform](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2020/10/01/announcing-new-innovations-for-the-microsoft-customer-data-platform/) and the video [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights—engagement insights capability](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2020/10/01/announcing-new-innovations-for-the-microsoft-customer-data-platform/).

If you need to refer to Product Insights in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Insights
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

- Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Product Insights

- Don't use *Dynamics 365 for Product Insights.* Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

**Our style**  
A project is a customer unit within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Insights. Once you create a project, you are the customer of Dynamics 365 Product Insights, and as that customer (project), you'll be using Product Insights services.

**Not our style**  
A project is a customer unit within Dynamics 365 for Product Insights. Once you create a project, you are the customer of D365 Product Insights, and as that customer (project), you'll be using D365–PI services.
