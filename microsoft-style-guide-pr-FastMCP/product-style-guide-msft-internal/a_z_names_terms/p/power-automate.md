# Power Automate

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, and collect data.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Power Automate

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Power Automate

Don't use the previous name, *Microsoft Flow,* unless you need to refer to earlier releases. (Microsoft Flow was renamed to Power Automate in November 2019.)

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Use of platform descriptors**

Power Automate is available as a web app, a mobile app, and a desktop app. In the past, words like *Mobile* and *Desktop* were included in the product name to signal which platform the app runs on.

Going forward, however, we don’t include the platform as part of the product name. Most of the time, you’ll just refer to *Power Automate.* When you need to reference the platform—for example, when you’re discussing functionality that’s available in the desktop app but not the mobile app—use messaging that accompanies the name.
