# Power BI

Microsoft Power BI is a suite of business analytics tools that deliver insights throughout your organization. With Power BI, customers can see data in new ways with interactive data visualization and business intelligence tools.

## General guidelines for including *Microsoft* in references to Power BI or Power BI Pro license

First mention: Microsoft Power BI

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Power BI name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Power BI

When a descriptor for the suite is needed, use "data visualization tools".

## Service

Power BI is a cloud-based analytics service. A Power BI Pro license is billed as a monthly subscription, and provides storage, data refresh, and support for creating and publishing apps (formerly content packs) to share reports and dashboards. A free license is available to enable employees to view content published in a Power BI Premium app.

First mention: Microsoft Power BI 

Subsequent mentions: Power BI

When a descriptor is required, it's OK to use *service,* as in “the Microsoft Power BI service.”

Don’t refer to the Power BI service as a web app or Powerbi.com. 

## Licenses

- A *Power BI Pro* license is a license for a paid monthly subscription.
- A *Power BI Premium license*, an add-on to the Power BI Pro license, is a license for a paid monthly subscription.
- A *Power BI (free)* license is a free option that enables viewing of content that’s hosted on Power BI Premium capacity.

Note the capitalization.

## Desktop

Power BI Desktop is the client version of Power BI intended for business analysts to connect to, analyze, and visualize data from a variety of sources. It includes full-fledged data-modeling and transformation capabilities, plus report authoring. Power BI Desktop has all the capabilities customers need to quickly connect, shape, visualize, and share data insights through Power BI. 

First mention: Microsoft Power BI Desktop

Subsequent mentions: Power BI Desktop

Where space is extremely limited and the context is clear, such as a dialog box overlay in the product, it's OK to use just *Desktop*. Don't include *the* in references to Power BI Desktop or Desktop. 

Don't use *Power BI Designer.* Use *Power BI Desktop* instead.

## Power BI Embedded

Power BI Embedded enables you to build Power BI reports into your web or mobile applications so you don’t need to build custom solutions to visualize data for your users. 

Power BI Embedded is an Azure service that enables software development companies to surface Power BI data experiences within their own applications. These apps might also have some built-in data elements like charts and reports that will be powered by Power BI Embedded.

First mention: Microsoft Power BI Embedded

## Power BI Mobile

Power BI Mobile refers to mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows, which aren't identical.

First mention (when referring to the app for all platforms collectively): Microsoft Power BI Mobile 

Subsequent mentions: Power BI Mobile 

For Windows: The Power BI mobile app for Windows 10

## Power BI gateways

There are two versions of the on-premises gateway (and using either requires a Power BI Pro license):

- Microsoft on-premises data gateway 

  A centrally managed gateway in which IT controls access to underlying data sources. Works with Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps. Multiuser.

- Microsoft on-premises data gateway (personal mode)

  A bridge for providing quick and secure data transfer between the Power BI service and on-premises data sources that support refresh. Each user has only one instance of a personal gateway. Works for Power BI only.

First mention:

- Microsoft on-premises data gateway 
- Microsoft on-premises data gateway (personal mode)

Subsequent mentions:

- gateway
- gateway (personal mode)

To refer to both gateways collectively, use *Microsoft* *on-premises data gateways.*

## Power BI data stories gallery

The data stories gallery is a showcase where Power BI community members can share their data stories.

## Power BI Report Builder

A tool for authoring paginated reports that you can publish to the Power BI service.

Don't abbreviate or form an acronym.

## Power BI Report Server

An offering of SQL Server Reporting Services that launched with Power BI Premium to allow organizations to build distributed, hybrid BI systems (a mix of cloud and on-premises deployments).

Don't abbreviate or form an acronym.

Lowercase when referring to an instance of a report server rather than the name of the offering.
