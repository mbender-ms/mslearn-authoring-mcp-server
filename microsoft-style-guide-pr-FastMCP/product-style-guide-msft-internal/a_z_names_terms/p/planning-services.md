# Planning Services

Microsoft Azure Deployment Planning Services helps customers understand what Microsoft Azure can do for their business and identifies projects that are best suited for the public cloud offering.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Deployment Planning Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Planning Services

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation, including *AZDPS* and *DPS*. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

To avoid repeating the word *service(s)*, don't use *Planning Services* *service*.
