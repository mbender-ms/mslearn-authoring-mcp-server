# provision

It's OK to use *provision* as a verb to mean:

- To configure or create a user, tenant, or other account and enable it with access to one or more services.
- To perform operations on and apply back-end configurations to a device to get it ready for use or ready for a new service.
- To perform back-end operations to get a security service ready for use.

For all but the most technical audiences, consider substituting simpler, more specific words about what's happening, such as *prepare, create, get ready, set up,* or *apply a group of settings to.* If you must use the verb *provision,* be sure to explain the meaning on the first reference because the word means different things in different contexts.
