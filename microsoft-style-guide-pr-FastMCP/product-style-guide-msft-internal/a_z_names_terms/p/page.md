# page

Use to refer to sequential pages in a wizard. Don’t use *screen* to refer to a wizard page.

For Power BI, use *page* to refer to any screen in the Power BI service. Reports can have multiple pages (each tab is its own page).

For webpages, if the context makes it clear that you're referring to a webpage, it's OK to use page.

**Examples**

- On the Favorites page, view all the dashboards and reports you've saved as favorites.
- Do you want to print all the pages in your report?
- Open a new page in your browser.
