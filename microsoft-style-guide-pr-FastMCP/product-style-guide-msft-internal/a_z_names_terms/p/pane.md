# pane

Use *pane* to refer to any window that isn't full screen.  

**Guidelines**  

- Avoid referring to panes. Instead, try to discuss what the customer needs to do.  
- Pane titles use sentence-style casing, not title casing.  
- In pane titles, use a plus sign to indicate *and*. Example: Users + groups  
- Include articles and prepositions in pane titles to avoid a robotic voice. Example: Add a connector  
- Lowercase the word *pane*, even in references to named panes.  

**Examples**

- On the **Web app** pane, give your site a name.  
- On the **Resource group** pane, select **Summary**.
