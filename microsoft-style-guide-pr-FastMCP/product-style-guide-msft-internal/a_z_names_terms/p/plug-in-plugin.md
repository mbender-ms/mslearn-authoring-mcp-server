# plug-in, plugin

Describes a component used to add specific abilities to an application.  

**Guidance**  

Use *plug-in* (with a hyphen) when describing a component that adds specific abilities to an application but doesn’t extend a large language model and isn’t called by AI.  

Use *plugin* (no hyphen) when describing a component that uses AI to extend a large language model with real-time knowledge in OpenAI, ChatGPT, Copilot, or other generative AI experiences.  

Don’t use either spelling as a synonym for *add-in* or *add-on*.  

**Examples**  

Use plug-ins to extend business processes via Microsoft Dataverse.  

Create a plug-in using Power Platform tools.  

Use the Microsoft 365 Defender plugin to generate more accurate results in Microsoft Security Copilot.  

OpenAI plugins connect ChatGPT to third-party applications.
