# Power Apps

Microsoft Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs.

## General guidelines for referring to Power Apps

*Power Apps* is two words, capital *P* and *A*.

First mention: Microsoft Power Apps

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Power Apps name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Power Apps

Don't use the previous, one-word spelling of the name, *PowerApps*.

Never shorten subsequent mentions to only *Apps*.

*Power Apps* is singular. Don’t treat it as plural in a sentence. For example, say, "Power Apps is a …" not "Power Apps are …".

Don’t use *Power App* or *Power Apps app* to refer to something created using Power Apps. Instead, use just *app*.

It's OK to use *Power Apps app* only when you're referring to the Power Apps app in Microsoft Teams that provides an integrated experience for app makers to create and edit apps and workflows within Microsoft Teams without having to switch between multiple apps and services.

## Power Apps for mobile devices

When you create an app using Power Apps, you can run that app on Apple and Android devices by using Power Apps for mobile devices.

In the past, we used the name *Power Apps Mobile*. Going forward, however, the names of Power Platform apps don’t include the platform that they run on. Most of the time, just refer to *Power Apps*. When you need to reference the platform—for example, when you’re discussing functionality that’s specific to the mobile app—use messaging that accompanies the name.

For details and examples, see [Referring to Power Platform product names](~\product-names\referring-to-power-platform-product-names.md).

## Power Apps Studio

Use *Power Apps Studio* to refer to the Power Apps authoring space that's available on most web browsers.

First mention: Microsoft Power Apps Studio

Subsequent mentions: Power Apps Studio

## Power Apps admin center

Don't use unless you’re referring to earlier functionality. Power Apps admin is now handled in the Power Platform admin center. See [admin center](~\a_z_names_terms\a\admin-center.md) for usage guidelines.

If you need to refer to the Power Apps admin center in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines:

First mention: Microsoft Power Apps admin center

Subsequent mentions: Power Apps admin center, the admin center

Lowercase *admin center*.

## powerapps.com, make.powerapps.com

Use *powerapps.com*—all lowercase—to refer to the marketing website. 

To refer to the Power Apps web-based portal, use *Power Apps*, or *make.powerapps.com* if the context requires a URL for clarity.
