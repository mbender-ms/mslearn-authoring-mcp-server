# Power Platform Tools

Power Platform Tools is an extension for Visual Studio that gives customers templates and other support in writing Dataverse plug-ins.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Power Platform Tools

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Power Platform Tools

Include the phrase "for Visual Studio" as needed in message to make it clear what the tools are for.

Don't include *the.* It's *Power Platform Tools,* not *the Power Platform Tools.*

**Example**  
Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio supports the rapid creation, debugging, and deployment of plug-ins. Before installing Power Platform Tools, you must have access to a Microsoft Dataverse environment.
