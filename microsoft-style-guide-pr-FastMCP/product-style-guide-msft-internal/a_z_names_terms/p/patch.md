# patch

In programming, *patch* means to repair a deficiency in the functionality of an existing routine or program, generally in response to an unforeseen need or set of operating circumstances.

Don't use *patch* in or to refer to Microsoft security products, unless you're referring to the Autopatch feature. Use *security update* instead. 

It's OK to use *patch* to refer to third-party products that use the term.

**See** [security update](~\a_z_names_terms\s\security-update.md)
