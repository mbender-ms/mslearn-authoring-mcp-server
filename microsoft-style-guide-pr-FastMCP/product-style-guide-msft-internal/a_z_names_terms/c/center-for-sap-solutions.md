# Center for SAP solutions

Azure Center for SAP solutions is an Azure service that helps customers to easily onboard SAP workloads to Azure and then manage those workloads from within a single management experience.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Center for SAP solutions

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Center for SAP solutions

Note that the word *solutions* in *SAP solutions* is lowercase. This is the style preferred by SAP.

Always spell out the name; with the exception of *SAP,* don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
