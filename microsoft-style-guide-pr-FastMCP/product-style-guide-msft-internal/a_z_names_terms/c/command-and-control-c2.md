# command-and-control (C2)

An attack activity that involves establishing communications to report status, relay reconnaissance results, receive additional commands, or transmit stolen data.

Use with a security admin audience only.

Always use the full term *command-and-control* on the first reference. The abbreviation *C2* can be used after the full term is spelled out. Don't use *C&C.*

*Hyphenate and use as a modifier, as in "command-and-control infrastructure."*
