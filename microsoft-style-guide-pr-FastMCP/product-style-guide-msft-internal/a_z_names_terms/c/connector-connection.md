# connector, connection

Developers make a *connector.* Customers use that prebuilt connector to *make a connection*.

A *connector* is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to products such as Power Automate, Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps. Connectors are used for integration and connectivity to provide access to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. Using connectors expands the capabilities between on-premises and cloud-based solutions to do tasks such as manage authentication, provide monitoring, perform analytics, and more. Customers can choose from prebuilt connectors or create a custom connector.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase.
- *Use a prebuilt connector* (developer message)
- *Build a custom connector* (developer message)
- *Make a connection* (customer/user message)

In UI and marketing, consider talking about the benefit rather than the feature details of connectors and connections between products. For example:

- Connecting your apps has never been easier
- Spend less time on complex app integrations and more time getting work done
- Get your apps working together in minutes, not months

**Our style**  
Use our connectors to integrate *[product name]* with other services  
Add a new connection  
App connections: Most apps require you're connected before you can exchange information with them.  
Connectors and API apps to use in your logic apps  
Build a storage queue connector  
Connectors are used in Azure Logic Apps as a part of a workflow  
The hybrid connectors extend the reach of Azure App Service further into the enterprise with connectivity to SAP, Oracle, DB2, Informix, and WebSphere MQ.  
A connector can be created within a logic app or be created directly from Azure Marketplace.
