# computer vision

In content for makers and analysts, it's OK to use *computer vision* as needed, without defining the term, to refer to the AI branch involved in understanding the information captured in digital images.

In content for end users, avoid AI technical terms like *computer vision.* Instead, focus on the user's intent and the steps they need to take to accomplish their task. If you need to talk about the technology, refer to specific features or functionality, such as *object calibration* or *camera calibration.*
