# Contacts list

A list of a someone's contacts.

In help and how-to content, use sentence-style capitalization, not lowercase, to make it easier to scan. That is, use *Contacts list,* not *contacts list.*

Don't use *address book.*

**Example**  
Instead of looking through your Contacts list to make a call, try using your voice.​
