# Connected Spaces

Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces uses observational data and mixed reality to allow people and computers to work together to understand a physical environment, automate responses, and help workers to do their jobs faster and more safely.

Connected Spaces will be replacing Dynamics 365 Connected Store.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Connected Spaces

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
