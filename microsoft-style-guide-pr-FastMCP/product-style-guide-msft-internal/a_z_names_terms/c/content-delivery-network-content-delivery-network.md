# Content Delivery Network, content delivery network

**Azure Content Delivery Network**

The Azure service that stores blobs at strategically placed locations to provide maximum bandwidth for delivering content to users.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Content Delivery Network

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Content Delivery Network

*Azure* isn't required in the name, but it's OK to use *Azure Content Delivery Network* on subsequent mentions as needed to distinguish the Azure service from generic references to *content delivery network.*

Always spell out the name; don't use *CDN, Azure CDN,* or any other acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**content delivery network**

In general, a content delivery network is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users.

Lowercase when referring generically to the technology.

Avoid the acronym *CDN* and spell the term out whenever possible. For more information, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
