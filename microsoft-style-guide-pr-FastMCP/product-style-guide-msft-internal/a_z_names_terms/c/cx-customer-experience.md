# CX, customer experience

**Guidelines**

When referring to the general interactions or perceptions a customer has with your brand, spell out the phrase *customer experience*.

When referring to the software, tools, platforms, solutions, or strategies that help companies manage and optimize customer experiences, it’s OK to spell out the term on first mention and use *CX* on

subsequent mentions. 

Don’t use *CX* on its own to refer to customer experience software, systems, or platforms. Use it as a modifier, such as CX platform.

**Examples**

Win customers and earn loyalty by elevating customer experiences. 

Drive more relevant engagement and build deeper connections with an end-to-end CX solution.
