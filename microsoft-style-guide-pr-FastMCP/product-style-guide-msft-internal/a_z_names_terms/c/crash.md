# crash

It's OK to use *crash* for an IT pro or developer audience instead of *stop responding* or *fail.* For consumer audiences, the preferred phrase is *stop responding.*

**Example**  
If you have compatible hardware and your computer still crashes, the first step is to remove any unnecessary hardware.
