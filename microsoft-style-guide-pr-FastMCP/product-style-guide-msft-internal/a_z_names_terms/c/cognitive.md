# cognitive

Avoid using _cognitive_ simply as a synonym for _intelligent_ or _smart._ Don't use it as shorthand to convey that a feature or capability uses AI. It's OK to use _cognitive_ in the Azure Cognitive Services product name and in the phrase _cognitive computing._

There's not clear agreement on what _cognitive computing_ means. (Some people use _cognitive computing_ and _AI_ interchangeably, others say that cognitive computing is a type of AI.) Therefore it's not clear what applying the adjective _cognitive_ to a noun actually communicates. Plus, _cognitive computing_ and especially the attributive _cognitive_ tend to be viewed as marketing buzzwords. Â
