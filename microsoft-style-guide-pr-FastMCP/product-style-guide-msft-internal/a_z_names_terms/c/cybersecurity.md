# cybersecurity

Practices, systems, and tools that provide protection against attacks that are designed to compromise or damage data, devices, and networks.  

​​Use *security* instead, unless you need to distinguish cybersecurity from traditional, physical security. 
 
Note that *cybersecurity* in the broadest sense also covers certain aspects of physical security, including controlling access to hardware and safeguarding people who have privileged access to systems.  

One word, no hyphen.
