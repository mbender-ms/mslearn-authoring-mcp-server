# capture

It's OK to use _capture_ to refer to the process of catching, acquiring, or preserving any digital activity—including images, video, chats, and video conferences—and the data from that activity. _Capture_ connotes that the activity is happening anyway, and the user or app is collecting it incidentally, for another purpose. _Capture_ isn't used in connection with the creation of something new. 

_Capture_ works best in UI labels, as features on menus or perhaps as button labels.

Try to write around it in explanatory text, though, for voice. In regular text, _capture_ can sound robotic and techy, and more familiar terms like _collect_ or _gather_ might sound friendlier and even be more descriptive.
