# Cloud App Discovery

Feature of Azure Active Directory that helps administrators identify SaaS apps being used within their organization. They can use this information to develop plans to mitigate potential security risks.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Cloud App Discovery feature of Microsoft Azure Active Directory

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Cloud App Discovery

Don't use *the Cloud App Discovery feature of Azure AD* (or otherwise abbreviate)

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
