# cocreate, cocreating



Used in reference to the partnership between an AI and a user when drafting content.

**Guidelines**

- Use *cocreate* (with no hyphen)
- Lowercase
- Instead of using *cocreate* (and its forms), consider being more specific when possible: create, draft, shorten, simplify, enhance, polish, or summarize.
