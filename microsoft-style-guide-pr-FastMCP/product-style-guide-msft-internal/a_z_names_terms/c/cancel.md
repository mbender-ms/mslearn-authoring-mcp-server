# cancel

To stop a task in progress and return to the previous state.

- Don't use to describe user actions. Substitute a more specific verb.
- Spell *canceled* and *canceling* with one *L,* but spell *cancellation* with two *Ls.*
- In UI, use as a button to stop a process or to close the page without saving changes.
- In help procedures, don’t include the words *the* and *button* with the button name—that is, don't use "the Cancel button."

**Examples**  
Stop the process.  
Close the page without saving changes.  
To stop a print job before it's finished, click or tap **Cancel**.
