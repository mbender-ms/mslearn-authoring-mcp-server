# compare, comparison

_Compare_ can be used in UI labels and explanations to describe actions that result in comparisons or analysis (visual or otherwise) of two or more sets of data.

_Comparison_ is less likely to be used as a UI label to frame or contextualize outputâ€”it's usually self-evident that what you're looking at is a comparison. But it can be used in explanations to describe the feature and its output.

**Examples**  

[UI label in Dynamics 365 Product Insights] **Compare** command in the **Overlay** menu  

Compare current trends in your signal data with historic trends.

To change the duration of the comparison, select **Compare** in the top-left corner of the chart.

[From Dynamics 365 Sales Insights]
