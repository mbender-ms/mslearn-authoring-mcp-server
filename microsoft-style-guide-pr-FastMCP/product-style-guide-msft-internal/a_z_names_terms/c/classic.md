# classic

Use *classic* as a way to signal a paradigm shift in a service. An example of a paradigm shift is the change from the classic deployment model to Resource Manager. The two deployment models are not compatible, they manage resources differently, and they use different API sets.

Donâ€™t use *classic* for incremental service changes.

You must review adding *classic* to a service name with the Cloud Marketing Naming Council. Contact [cmnaming@microsoft.com](mailto:cmnaming@microsoft.com).
