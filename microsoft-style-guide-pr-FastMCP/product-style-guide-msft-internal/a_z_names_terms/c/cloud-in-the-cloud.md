# cloud, in the cloud

Don't capitalize *cloud* except in references to the Microsoft Cloud or when it’s part of a product name.

Use *cloud* mostly as an adjective. Use sparingly as a noun—instead of *the cloud* or *in the cloud,* talk about *cloud computing, cloud services,* or a specific service or functionality and what the customer can do with it.

Don’t use generic references to *the cloud* when you mean Azure. To avoid confusion and promote Microsoft branding, refer to Azure by name.
