# cc

A field in an email header where you specify which recipients are receiving a message for informational purposes only. Recipients of such "courtesy copies" aren't expected to take action or participate in the discussion.

Note capitalization; don't use uppercase (*CC* or *Cc*) in regular text.

**Exception**  
It often appears capitalized in the UI because of capitalization style.

Don't use ending punctuation.
