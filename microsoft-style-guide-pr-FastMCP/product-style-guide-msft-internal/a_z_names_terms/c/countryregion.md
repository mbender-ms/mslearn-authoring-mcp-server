# country/region

A geographical area in which something might or might not be available. One country might not be considered a country by another. A region might correspond to borders of one or more entities, or might have nothing to do with borders, depending on the scenario.

- Always use *country or region* when discussing products, tools, services, or other items that might or might not be available in all places.
- Don't use *country* on its own unless talking about a specific country. Such usage can create international incidents requiring expensive product fixes and much repairing of the company's relationship with the offended party.
- Always use *country/region* as a list label in UI text.
- Don't substitute other terms such as *market, subsidiary market, sub* (industry jargon), *area* (a portion of a displayed surface), or *location* (network, file storage, and maps).
- Use *might not be available in your country or region* rather than *isn't available.* Although it might be true that it isn't available at the time that the content is released, that definitive phrasing creates a content maintenance problem. Using "might not" also helps avoid discouraging people unnecessarily. Customers may understand "isn't" to mean that it's true for their market, which it might not be.
- It's OK to use the example below as a generic disclaimer, but you can substitute *service* with the name of the service or feature for clarity.

**Example**  
This service might not be available in your country or region.â€¯
