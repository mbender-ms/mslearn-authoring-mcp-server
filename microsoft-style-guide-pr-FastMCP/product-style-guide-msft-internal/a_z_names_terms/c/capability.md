# capability

In the context of AI agents, a capability or capabilities are one or more actions an agent can perform to help users achieve an objective.

**Guidelines**

- Rather than refer to an agent's capabilities, try to be specific about what it can help users achieve or do.
- If you need to use the term, don't confuse it with *skill* or *job*.
