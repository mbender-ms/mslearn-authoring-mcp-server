# cross filter, cross highlight

In content for Power BI, use *cross filter* to mean removing all data from a set of visuals except the data you want to focus on.

Use *cross highlight* to refer to highlighting related results for a specific data point across a set of visuals. For example, selecting a bar in a bar chart results in highlighting the related values in the other visuals on the page.Â 

Hyphenate only when used as an adjective that modifies a noun. All other forms are two words with no hyphen.

**Examples:**

- Use the Filters pane to cross filter and cross highlight.  
- Cross-filtered visuals show only the data you want to focus on.
