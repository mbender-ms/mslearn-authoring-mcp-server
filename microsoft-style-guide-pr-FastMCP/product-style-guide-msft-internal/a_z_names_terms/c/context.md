# context

In the world of generative AI, *context* generally refers to the grounding data supplied to the model in order to improve or fine-tune outcomes.  

**Guidelines**

- OK to use descriptively.
- Use as a friendlier alternative to terms like *grounding* or *retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)*.

**Examples**

- When you’re creating a Copilot agent, you can add sources to give it context about a particular domain, topic, or area of business.
- Copilot works best when it has context for the questions you’re asking. For example, try sharing a file with Copilot and asking about its content.
- LLMs can use grounding data to get context on specific topics or domains and provide more accurate and relevant results.
