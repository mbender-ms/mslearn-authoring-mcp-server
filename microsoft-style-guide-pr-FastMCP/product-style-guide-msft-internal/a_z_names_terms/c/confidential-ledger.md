# confidential ledger

Microsoft Azure confidential ledger is a managed service built on top of the Confidential Consortium Framework that spins up a permissioned blockchain network of nodes within Azure confidential computing.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure confidential ledger, the Microsoft Azure confidential ledger service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: the confidential ledger service, confidential ledger

Note that *confidential ledger* is lowercase. This is an intentional exception to our [capitalization standards for product names](~\capitalization-standards\product-names-vs-instances.md).

Because confidential ledger is an Azure service, it's acceptable and correct to join it with *Azure,* as in *Azure confidential ledger.* But after the Azure brand context has been established, it's OK to use just *confidential ledger* without *Azure.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
