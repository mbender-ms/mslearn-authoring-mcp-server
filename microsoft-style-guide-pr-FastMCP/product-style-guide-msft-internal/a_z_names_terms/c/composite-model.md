# composite model

Internally, *composite model* (and *proxy model*) are used to refer to a report in Power BI Desktop that has both DirectQuery and imported data sources.

Donâ€™t use these terms in customer-facing content, including in UI text. Instead, describe a model that has multiple data sources.
