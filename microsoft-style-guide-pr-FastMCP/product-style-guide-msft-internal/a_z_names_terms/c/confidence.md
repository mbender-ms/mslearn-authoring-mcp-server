# confidence

OK to use as an adjective in phrases like *confidence score* and *confidence level* if necessary in technical content. Define the terms unless you're sure your audience is familiar with them.

As a UI label, *confidence* is the preferred term for contextualizing results, predictions, and other system-generated output. Include a modifier when it adds clarity about the nature of the output. For example:  

- Affinity confidence  
- Answer confidence
