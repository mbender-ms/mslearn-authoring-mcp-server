# cloud service, cloud services

Use *cloud service* or *cloud services* to refer to the services provided via the cloud—such as servers, storage, databases, and software. Don’t use it to describe consumer services, such as Xbox Live.

The term *cloud service* can also refer to:

- An instance of Azure Cloud Services.
- A solution the customer builds by using Azure Cloud Services.

Lowercase in both contexts.

Don't use *cloud service* to refer generally to software that's developed for deploying to Azure. Use *app* or *application* instead.
