# change

To replace one thing with another.

When to use *change* in UI buttons or action link text:

- Use *change* in UI where the user can swap out one option for another option, such as change your default payment method or change your status.
- Use *edit* for UI where you can edit information, such as a username, description, or password.
- Use *manage* in UI when *edit* is too specific because there are multiple tasks you can do, such as set up, update, reorder items, add, and remove, all in one place.
- Avoid *configure.* Substitute *set up, edit,* or *manage,* depending on the specific capability.

For button or link labels, use the verb in combination with an object if this is the primary call to action on the page.

If the link is a secondary action, and longer link text might be distracting, use just the verb as visible link text (for example, *Change*), but provide *Change+object* in the ARIA text.
