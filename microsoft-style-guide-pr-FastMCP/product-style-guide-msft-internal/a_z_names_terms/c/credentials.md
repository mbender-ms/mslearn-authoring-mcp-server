# credentials

With a Microsoft account, customer credentials are their sign-in information (email address and password).  
Don't refer to credentials in customer-facing content. You can either be specific about the sign-in info a user might need or eliminate the info details entirely.

**Do**

- Enter your username and password.
- Enter your email address and password to sign in to your Microsoft account.
- Sign in to your work or school account.

**Don't**

- Type in your credentials.
