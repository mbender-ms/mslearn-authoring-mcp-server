# customer engagement

For information about the name of the Dynamics 365 on-premises app, see [Customer Engagement (on-premises)](~\a_z_names_terms\c\customer-engagement-on-premises.md). 

**Collective term**

Whenever possible, refer to a specific app. However, when itâ€™s necessary to refer collectively to the category of apps that includes Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, and Project Service Automation, it's OK to use *customer engagement.* Don't use *model-driven apps* to refer to these apps collectively.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase *customer engagement.*
- Avoid wording that makes it sound like *customer engagement* is a product name. Specifically, never use "Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement."

**Our style**  

Explore customer engagement apps to learn how Dynamics 365 helps build and support your customer relationships.

Customer Engagement licensing plan  
Starting with the October 1, 2019, release, the Customer Engagement licensing plan was phased out. For information about current licensing plans, see the Dynamics 365 pricing page. 

**Referring to the underlying platform**

**For online customers:** Don't use *platform* or *customer engagement platform.* Refer to *Microsoft Dataverse* instead. Dataverse is the underlying platform for the customer engagement apps. 

**For on-premises customers:** It's OK to use *Customer Engagement platform* in the context of the on-premises apps. The Customer Engagement platform has a lot of features in common with Dataverse, but new platform features and enhancements are getting added to Dataverse.
