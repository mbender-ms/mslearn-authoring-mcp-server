# Container Apps

Azure Container Apps is an Azure service that provides a general-purpose, serverless container platform. Customers use Container Apps to create containerized microservices that serve as back-end services, job-processing services, or long-running processes that can scale, upgrade, and communicate with other services.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Container Apps

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Container Apps

Don’t use the previous name, *Azure Worker Apps.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
