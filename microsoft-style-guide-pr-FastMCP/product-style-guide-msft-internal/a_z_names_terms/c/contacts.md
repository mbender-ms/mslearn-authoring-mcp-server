# contacts

A person's contacts (people and businesses).

Don't use *people* or *person* in this context because they might result in odd phrases or connotations.

Use *contacts* in the following examples: 

- **Contact card:** Use “Delete contact?” not “Delete person?”
- **Chooser:** Use “New contact” not "New person"
- **Temp card:** Use “Save contact” not “Save person”
