# the commercial marketplace

*The commercial marketplace* enables software development companies to publish products and services into the Microsoft online product catalog and sell them through multiple channels, including two online stores—Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace—plus Microsoft field sellers, Microsoft partners, and in-product experiences such as Azure portal and Microsoft 365 apps.  

**Guidelines**  

- Lowercase.  
- Always include *the*. It's *the commercial marketplace*, not *commercial marketplace*.  
- First mention: the Microsoft commercial marketplace.  
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the words *the commercial marketplace*—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word Microsoft has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like an earlier reference to the company or a product name.

- Subsequent mentions: the marketplace.
