# confirmation

In product, a confirmation message asks the customer to verify they want to complete the action they just initiated.  

**Guidelines**

- Only use a confirmation message if the action the user selected is both significant and irreversible or could be inconvenient if that wasn't their intent. (Otherwise, confirming they indeed want to do it is an annoying interruption.)
- Be specific about the consequences, if known.
- Use [Yes] [No] if customers need to understand the consequences in order to make the right decision. [Yes] [No] makes it more likely customers will read the message than [X] [Cancel].
- Do not use the phrase "are you sure" and instead use "do you want to â€¦" if needed.

**Examples**

**Our style**  

- If you do X, Y will happen. Are you sure you want to do X? [Yes] [No]
- If you do X, you'll have to do Y to achieve Z. Do you want to do X anyway? [Do X] [Do Z]
- If you cancel, the information you entered will be lost. Are you sure you want to cancel? [Yes] [No]

**Not our style**

- You can't undo this change. [Continue] [Cancel]
- Are you sure you want to delete this file? [Delete] [Cancel]
