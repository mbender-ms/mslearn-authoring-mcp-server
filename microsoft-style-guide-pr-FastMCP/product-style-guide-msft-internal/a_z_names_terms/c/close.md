# close

A windowing operation that doesn’t have a direct relationship to the state of the content of the window.

The standard button that looks like an "x" in a box is called "Close." An app will often take the Close event and act on it, so if you try to close a window that has unsaved changes, the app might automatically save the changes or might prompt the user to save them.

This is different than "Cancel," which explicitly relates to both content and the window state; you discard any changes and close the window. “Cancel” is almost exclusively a dialog box command.
