# cybercriminal

​Use for all audiences to refer to individuals or groups who are responsible for organized, malicious activities on the internet—such as malware distribution, phishing, or unauthorized network intrusions—that are pursued with criminal intent.

Avoid using *cybercriminal* to refer to individuals who perform one-off activities on the internet that might be deemed illegal in certain regions.

When writing for security operations teams, security admins, researchers, and other security practitioners, use terms like *nation-state actors* and *dissidents* to refer to groups that launch malicious activities for warfare, espionage, or other political purposes.

One word, no hyphen.
