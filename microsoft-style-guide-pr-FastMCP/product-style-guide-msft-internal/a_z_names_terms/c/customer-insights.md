# Customer Insights

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies: 

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name. 

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: 

Customer Insights 

Don't use *Customer 360.* It's an out-of-date code name. Don't use *Dynamics 365 for Customer Insights.* Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
