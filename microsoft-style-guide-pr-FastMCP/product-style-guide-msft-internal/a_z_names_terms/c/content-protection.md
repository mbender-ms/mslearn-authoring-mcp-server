# Content Protection

Protects premium video content with static and dynamic encryption and a range of industry-standard encryption options like PlayReady DRM and Clearkey AES.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Content Protection
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Content Protection
  - Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
