# Chaos Studio

Microsoft Azure Chaos Studio is an Azure service that enables developers, architects, IT pros, and site reliability engineers to create, run, and analyze different chaos experiments to identify resilience gaps in their cloud apps.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Chaos Studio

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Chaos Studio

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
