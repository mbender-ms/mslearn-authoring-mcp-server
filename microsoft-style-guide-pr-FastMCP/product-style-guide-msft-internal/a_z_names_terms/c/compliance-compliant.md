# compliance, compliant

OK to use to refer generally to meeting an organization's various obligations, which may arise from laws, regulations, rules, and other legal instruments.

- ​Use in terms of describing how a solution, feature, or technology contributes to compliance, but not in a way that guarantees the organization's compliance.

- Try to avoid calling things like a configuration *compliant* or *noncompliant* with a regulation, standard, certification, or law—that could imply a guarantee.

- Always be clear and specific about what a thing is "compliant" with.

- For labels or categories, use *noncompliant;* in narrative text, use *not compliant.* Beware that both of those terms will localize to the same word, so don't use them to mean different things.

**Example**  
Compliance Manager helps you track your organization's compliance with data-protection regulations and standards, such as GDPR.
