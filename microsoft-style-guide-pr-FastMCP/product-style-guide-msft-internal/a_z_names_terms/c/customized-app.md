# customized app

In general, use _app_ or _customized app_ not _app module_ to refer to a purpose-built, customized version of Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, or another customer engagement app that provides a limited set of functionality that’s relevant for a specific group of users.

**Guidelines**

- In content for business users, use _app_ and not _app module._ Most business users just experience an app module as an app.
- In technical content for a dev/admin audience, use _customized app_ when it's necessary to refer specifically to the customized version of the app (when the customization was done by the customer or a partner) or when you need to distinguish the customized version from the base version (for example, when explaining the difference between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Sales Professional).
- The term _customized app_ is lowercase, but the name of a specific customized app uses title-style capitalization—for example, Dynamics 365 Sales Professional or Sales Hub.

**Exception**  
It’s OK to use _AppModule_ in references to the entity type where information about the purpose-built app is stored. Note the capitalization and spelling.

To learn more about sentence-style capitalization, see [Capitalization standards](~\capitalization-standards\capitalization-standards.md).
