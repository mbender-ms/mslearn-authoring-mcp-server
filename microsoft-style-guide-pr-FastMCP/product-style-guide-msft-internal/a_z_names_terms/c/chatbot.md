# chatbot

For general guidelines for the term *chatbot,* see [AI and bot terms](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/ai-bot-terms) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide.*

In introductory material or higher-level references—like in an overview paragraph or the title area of a dialog box—use *chatbot.*

After that, in more detailed content or deeper in the user experience, it's safe to use *bot* because the user already knows what kind of bot it is.
