# Cross-tenant Teams Migration

Cross-tenant Teams Migration is a feature that will migrate all of the specified user’s chats and meetings so that users can access their chat history and continue to use the same threads and meetings moving forward. It falls into the larger Data Migration Suite which does a similar migration process for OneDrive/SharePoint and Exchange Mailboxes.
