# Customer Service

Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides many features and tools that companies can use to manage the services they provide to customers, including the ability to track customer issues through cases and record all interactions related to a case.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Customer Service

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Customer Service.”

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
