# Customer Service Insights for Dynamics 365 Customer Service

The Customer Service Insights add-in gives you actionable insights into critical performance metrics, operational data, and emerging trends from your customer service system.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Customer Service Insights Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Customer Service Insights for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Customer Service Insights  

If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, you can omit *Dynamics 365.*  

Don’t refer to Customer Service Insights as an app. Don't use *AI for Customer Service.*  

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
