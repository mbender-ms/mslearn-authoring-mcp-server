# cancel vs. close

Don't confuse when to use [Close] and when to use [Cancel]. 

**Cancel**

Cancel (v.) is a button that stops the task in progress and returns to the previous state. Cancel explicitly relates to both content and the pane or window state; you discard any changes and close the window. Cancel is almost exclusively a dialog box command.

Guidelines for use: 

- Don't use to describe user actions. Substitute a more specific verb.  
- Spell canceled and canceling with one l, but spell cancellation with two l's. 

Examples: 

- Stop the process.  
- Close the page without saving changes. 

**Close**

Close (v.) is the action someone takes when closing a window, a dialog box, or a webpage. A browser or program may also close when it has a problem and can't continue. 

The standard button that looks like an "X" in a box is called "Close." Close is an operation that doesn't have a direct relationship to the state of the content of the pane or window. A program will often take the Close event and act on it, so if you try to close a window that has unsaved changes, the program might automatically save the changes or might prompt the user to save them.
