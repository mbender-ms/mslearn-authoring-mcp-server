# Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service

The Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides agent access to the omnichannel interface and our live chat messaging channel.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Chat Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Chat for Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Chat

Capitalize *Chat* only in references to the product. In general references, use *chat,* lowercase. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
