# Connected Store

Dynamics 365 Connected Store is a standalone application that uses video cameras, IoT sensors, and machine learning to understand people, things, and environments in the real world and generate actionable insights and recommendations.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies: 

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name. 

Subsequent mentions: Connected Store 

Don't use the former name, *Dynamics 365 Spatial Insights.*

Don't include *for* in the name, as in *Dynamics 365 for Connected Store.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
