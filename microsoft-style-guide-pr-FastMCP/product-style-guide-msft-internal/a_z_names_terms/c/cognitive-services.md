# Cognitive Services

**Note:** *The family of Azure Cognitive Services is being realigned, and the following guidelines may change in the future.* *The style guide topics related to Cognitive Services will be updated as soon as the naming and portfolio changes are finalized.*

Cognitive Services is a set of APIs, SDKs, and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging, and discoverable.

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Cognitive Services
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym (ACS or CS) or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
