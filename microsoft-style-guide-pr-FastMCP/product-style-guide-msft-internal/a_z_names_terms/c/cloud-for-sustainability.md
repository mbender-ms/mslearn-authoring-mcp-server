# Cloud for Sustainability

Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability helps companies measure, understand, and take charge of their carbon emissions, set sustainability goals, and take measurable action.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, Cloud for Sustainability
- Although it's not required, we recommend using the full name *Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability* whenever possible, even if the Microsoft brand context is clear or you've already used the full name earlier.
- Don’t include *the.* It’s *Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability,* not *the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability.*
