# Cloud App Security

In November 2021, Cloud App Security was rebranded and the name changed to Defender for Cloud Apps.  
If you need to refer to Cloud App Security in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.  

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Cloud App Security  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Cloud App Security  
Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**See** [Defender for Cloud Apps](~/a_z_names_terms/m/microsoft-defender/microsoft-defender-for-cloud-apps.md)
