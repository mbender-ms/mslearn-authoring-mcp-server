# ChatGPT, ChatGPT Plus

ChatGPT and the ChatGPT Plus subscriptions are offerings from OpenAI, the research entity. Neither are Microsoft products nor technologies. Learn more at [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/).

**Guidelines**  

In marketing and communications, it's OK to use ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus when referring to that company and their AI tools (but not when referring to Microsoft or Microsoft Azure OpenAI’s service, technology, or models).  

Do not use a specific GPT model (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT) in product or feature names.  

It's okay to use GPT when the product actually includes OpenAI’s technology (not Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, technology, and models). If a product does include ChatGPT, specify OpenAI as the maker as in “… includes OpenAI’s ChatGPT” or “… includes ChatGPT from OpenAI” (per CELA and Brand group).

**OpenAI Guidelines**  

Before referencing any OpenAI names or brand assets in Microsoft offerings based on OpenAI technology—including those that leverage Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service—consult CELA’s legal guidelines:
