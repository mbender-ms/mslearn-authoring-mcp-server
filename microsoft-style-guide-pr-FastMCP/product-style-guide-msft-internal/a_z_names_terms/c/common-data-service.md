# Common Data Service

In November 2020, Common Data Service was renamed to [Microsoft Dataverse](~\a_z_names_terms\d\dataverse-dataverse-for-teams.md).  

In December 2020, the security role named *Common Data Service User* was renamed to *Basic User.*

**Exception**  
The documentation will continue to use the following term:
