# Commerce

Dynamics 365 Commerce is an end-to-end retail solution that delivers unified commerce across all channels.

## Guidelines for references to Dynamics 365 Commerce

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Commerce 

Don't use the former name, *Dynamics 365 for Retail.*

Use *Commerce,* not *Retail,* to refer to the app with Rushmore functionality (either the version released in public preview in October 2019 or the one released in February 2020).

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in *Dynamics 365 for Commerce.*

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
