# component

Components are the building blocks that make up an app's user interface. Components range from radio buttons to wizards. Simple components are often grouped together to create complex components, like a modal that contains buttons, a drop-down menu, and a check box.

In Power Apps, components can be created on the canvas in a canvas app or designed and built using the Power Apps component framework.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase the word *component*.
- For component names, use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.
