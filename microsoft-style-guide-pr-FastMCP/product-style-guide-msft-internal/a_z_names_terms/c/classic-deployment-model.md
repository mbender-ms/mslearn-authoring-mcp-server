# classic deployment model

A reference to the original deployment model.

**Guidelines**

- Use *classic deployment model.*

- When referring to resources created and managed with the classic deployment model, don't say, for example, *classic virtual machine*. This is misleading. Virtual machines and other resources created using different deployment models have some differences but are fundamentally the same thing. Instead, say, for example, *virtual machine created using the classic deployment model* and then just *virtual machine.*
