# Container Service

Azure Container Service makes it simple to create, configure, and manage a cluster of virtual machines that are preconfigured to run containerized applications.

Note: This has been replaced by Azure Kubernetes Service. Use the original name only when specifically referring to the older Azure Container Service.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Container Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Container Service

To avoid repeating the word *service*, don't use *Container Service service*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
