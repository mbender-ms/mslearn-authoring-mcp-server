# CRM, customer relationship management

**Guidelines**  

It’s OK to use *CRM* on first mention without spelling out customer relationship management if the context is clear and you’re sure your audience knows what it stands for.
  
Use it as a modifier, such as *CRM platform*.  

Don’t use *CRM* on its own to refer to customer relationship management software, systems, or platforms.  

Don't use *CRM* as a noun without *software*, *systems*, or *platforms*.  

Don't use an article (a, an, the) before *CRM*.  

**Our style**  
Automatically capture and enter customer data into your organization’s CRM platform.  

**Not our style**  
The CRM expands your customer's insights and strategies.
