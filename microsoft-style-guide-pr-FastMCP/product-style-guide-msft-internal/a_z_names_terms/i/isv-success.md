**Guidelines**

- All mentions: ISV Success
- Unbranded, title cased
- Never localize
- Do not pair *ISV Success* with *program* together in a single phrase. For example: "The ISV Success program is designed to help you."
- Instead use *program* to describe ISV Success. For example: â€œWelcome to ISV Success, a program designed to help you."
