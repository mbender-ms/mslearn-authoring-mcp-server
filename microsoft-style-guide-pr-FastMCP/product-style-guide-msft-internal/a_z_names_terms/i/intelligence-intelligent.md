# intelligence, intelligent

In general, use *intelligence* and *intelligent* terms only to refer to features and functionality that employ AI. It's also OK to use the term *AI* when describing features and functionality. While customer research has shown customers equate *intelligent/intelligence* with AI and have positive associations with the term *intelligent technology*—it's even clearer to explicitly state that our product capabilities incorporate *AI* or are *AI powered.*

Don’t use *intelligent* or *intelligence* to describe computing or processing functionality in general.

**Product names**

Similar to *smart,* do not include *intelligent* in product names. As AI functionality is part of more and more products, it is unnecessary to call out *some* products as *intelligent.*

**Product UI**

When you're referring to an AI technology or AI-powered feature, the wording you choose depends on where you are in the UX.

At the top level of the progressive disclosure, avoid talking about the technology and instead focus on the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it. That means don't use "intelligent," "smart," or "AI-powered" in UI labels. Describe the capability or benefit, not the technology.

Deeper in the disclosure, if it becomes necessary to refer to the technology: Use the feature name (for example, sentiment checker), technology name (for example, sentiment analysis), "intelligent feature," or "intelligent technology." It's also OK to say "AI."
