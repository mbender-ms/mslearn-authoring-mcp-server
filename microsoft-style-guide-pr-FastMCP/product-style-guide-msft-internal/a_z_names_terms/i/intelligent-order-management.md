# Intelligent Order Management

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management is a standalone business application that streamlines and automates the order management process, from purchase to delivery.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Intelligent Order Management

Always spell out *Intelligent Order Management.* Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
