# IE mode

IE mode makes it easy to open legacy Internet Explorer 11 sites in Microsoft Edge.

**Guidelines**

All mentions: IE mode

Note that *mode* is lowercase. Never use *IE Mode* or *Internet Explorer mode.*

The word *mode* should be localized, but *IE* shouldn't be localized.

**Example**  
​​When a site loads in IE mode, the IE logo indicator displays on the left side of the navigation bar.
