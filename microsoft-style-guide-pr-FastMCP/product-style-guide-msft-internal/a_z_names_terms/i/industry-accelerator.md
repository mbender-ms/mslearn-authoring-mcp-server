# industry accelerator

Industry accelerators are foundational components within Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 that enable software development companies and other solution providers to quickly build industry vertical solutions.

**Referring to industry accelerators collectively**

Lowercase *industry accelerator.* You can use singular or plural, as needed for the context.

Don't use *industry solution accelerators* or *solution accelerators*â€”industry accelerators aren't solutions. Essentially, software companies and customers can use the accelerators to accelerate their path to their own solutions.

Don't call these *apps.* They're only data packages, not apps.

**Referring to specific industry accelerators**

The names of specific industry accelerators include just *accelerator,* not *industry accelerator.* Names for specific accelerators include:

- Dynamics 365 automotive accelerator
- Dynamics 365 education accelerator, with two components:
  - higher education
  - K-12 component
- Dynamics 365 financial services accelerator, with two components:
  - banking
  - insurance (preview)
- Dynamics 365 healthcare accelerator
- Dynamics 365 manufacturing accelerator
- Dynamics 365 media and entertainment accelerator
- Dynamics 365 nonprofit accelerator

If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, you can omit *Dynamics 365* and use the accelerator name alone.

Although the industry accelerators are also for Microsoft Power Platform, they're Dynamics 365 branded. Include messaging text as needed to clarify what the industry accelerators are and what products they're for.

Lowercase the name of the accelerator. Include *the* as needed for natural-sounding phrasing.

**Our style**  
Industry accelerators are foundational components within Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 that enable software development companies and other solution providers to quickly build industry vertical solutions.  
With the higher education component in the Dynamics 365 education accelerator, you can develop solutions that are based on entities and attributes that higher-education institutions use. The K-12 component in the Dynamics 365 education accelerator sits on top of an existing Dynamics 365 instance or Power Apps instance to assist with day-to-day operations or as a standalone data model for developers.

**Not our style**  
With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data-driven solutions, the team is taking it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators.
