# Internet of Things, IoT

In general, on the first mention, spell out *Internet of Things* unless you're sure that your audience knows the term or if *IoT* appears as part of a Microsoft product name. Introduce the acronym *IoT* in parentheses if appropriate.

On subsequent mentions, you can use just *IoT.*

**Exception**  
In UI navigation, spell out *Internet of Things* as a category label, and don't include the acronym in parentheses.

Note the capitalization.

Include *the* with the spelled-out term but not with the acronym.

In particular, don't spell out *Internet of Things* in references to Azure IoT names; always use *IoT.*
