# IP address

Always use *IP address;* don't spell out *Internet Protocol address.* 

On subsequent mentions after *IP address* has been used, you can use just *IP* if the meaning is clear. (The term *IP* is also an abbreviation for *intellectual property.*) For example, in a list of IPV4 addresses, the table header could be just *IP.*

**Example**  
The IP will be assigned to your device by your router.
