# info

**Guidelines**

Avoid using as an abbreviation for *information* unless modern voice calls for it, like in link text or a heading.

International consideration: Using the abbreviation *info* doesn't save space when content is localized. In many languages, the full term is translated anyway because an abbreviation is not available.
