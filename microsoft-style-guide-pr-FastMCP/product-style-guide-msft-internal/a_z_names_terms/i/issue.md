# issue

**Guidelines**

Microsoft 365: use *issue* as a collective descriptor of service health incidents and advisories, or any potential service disruption reported by a customer.

Security: use *issue* to refer to an event or a set of events that constitutes an attack that has the potential to cause interruption, disruption, loss, or damage.

Consumer-facing error messages: use *problem* instead of *issue* or *error* to describe something that went wrong.
