# Identity Manager

Identity Manager brings Microsoft identity and access management solutions together by bridging multiple on-premises authentication stores like Active Directory, LDAP, and Oracle with Azure Active Directory.  

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Identity Manager
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Identity Manager
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
