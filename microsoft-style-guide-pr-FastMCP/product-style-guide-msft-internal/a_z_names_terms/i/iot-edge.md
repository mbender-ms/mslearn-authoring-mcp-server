# IoT Edge

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure IoT Edge

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: IoT Edge

IoT Edge is an intentional exception in that it allows an acronym to be used in the name. Don't spell out *Internet of Things* in references to the IoT Edge name; always use *IoT.*

**Guidelines for IoT Edge for Linux on Windows**

IoT Edge for Linux on Windows is a deployment option of Azure IoT Edge that allows users to run Linux containers on Windows under the IoT Edge context.
