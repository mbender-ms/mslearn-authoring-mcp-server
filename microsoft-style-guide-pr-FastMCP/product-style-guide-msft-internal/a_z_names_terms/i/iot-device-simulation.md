# IoT Device Simulation

As of May 6, 2021, IoT Device Simulation is no longer supported. This repository has been archived. See this [GitHub notice](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-device-simulation) for more information.

If you need to refer to IoT Device Simulation in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure IoT Device Simulation

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: IoT Device Simulation

IoT Device Simulation is an intentional exception in that it allows an acronym to be used in the name. Don't spell out *Internet of Things* in references to the IoT Device Simulation name; always use *IoT.*
