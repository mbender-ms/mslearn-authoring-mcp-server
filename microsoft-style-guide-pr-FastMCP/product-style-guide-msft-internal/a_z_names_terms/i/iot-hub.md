# IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure, bidirectional communications between millions of IoT devices and a solution back end.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure IoT Hub

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: IoT Hub

Note capitalization of the service name. Also note that an instance of this service is a *hub,* lowercase.

IoT Hub is an intentional exception in that it allows an acronym to be used in the service name. Don't spell out *Internet of Things* in references to the Azure IoT Hub name; always use *IoT.*

Use lowercase *device provisioning service.* Don't use *DPS.*
