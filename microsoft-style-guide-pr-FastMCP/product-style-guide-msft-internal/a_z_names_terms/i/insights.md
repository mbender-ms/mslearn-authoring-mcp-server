# insights

**In Cloud + AI brand and naming strategy,** _insights_ is reserved to describe technology that meets certain criteria:

- _Insights_ signals to customers that the functionality takes advantage of AI. But don’t use _insights_ to mean AI in general.
- Use _analytics_ and _insights_ appropriately. _Analysis_ provides clarity of data (like dashboards). _Insights_ signals concrete advice (AI-infused reasoning of data).
- To be called _insights_ and not just _analytics,_ the offering:
  - Must be built on AI.
  - Must provide more than analysis, but also actionable intelligence, concrete suggestions, or both.

Avoid using _insight/insights_ in UI text strings and the names of features and capabilities. As AI is incorporated into more and more functionality, it will be confusing if we identify _some_ features with _insights_ and not others that might also be AI enabled. Instead, use specific, descriptive wording that conveys the nature of the AI output, such as _Suggestions_ or _Ideas._

It's OK to use _insight/insights_ sparingly in marketing, support content, and similar text, if it’s necessary to provide more context or background for a feature that uses AI to provide suggestions or actionable intelligence.

**In Power BI,** _insights_ and _quick insights_ are the names of features. See [quick insights](~\a_z_names_terms\q\quick-insights.md).
