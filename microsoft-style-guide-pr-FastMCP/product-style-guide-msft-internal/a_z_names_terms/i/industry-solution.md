# industry solution

The term *industry solution* is a variant on solution, which is used throughout Cloud + AI division product lines to mean a set of products that work together to solve a business problem. (See [solution](~\a_z_names_terms\s\solution.md) for more information.)

In content for Azure IoT, use the term solution or industry solution, not industry accelerator.

See [industry accelerator](~\a_z_names_terms\i\industry-accelerator.md) for information about the use of that term in Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365.
