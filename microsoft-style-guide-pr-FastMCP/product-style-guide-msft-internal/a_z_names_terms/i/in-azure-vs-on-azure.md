# in Azure vs. on Azure

Preposition use depends on context, so there isn’t always a definitive answer for whether to say *in Azure* or *on Azure.*

In general though, things happen *in* the Azure cloud (which we perceive as three-dimensional), and *on* the Azure platform (which we perceive as two-dimensional). If you aren’t sure whether to use *in* or *on,* add *cloud* or *platform* to the phrasing, depending on your meaning, and choose the option that sounds best.

| Sentence | Context | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security in Azure is important because …. | Security in [the] Azure [cloud] is important because …. | - When the context is the Azure cloud, use *in.* <br/>- We wouldn’t say "Security *on* the cloud is important"—we’d say, "Security *in* the cloud is important." |
| Red Hat on Azure enables you to …. | Red Hat on [the] Azure [platform] enables you to …. | - When the context is the Azure platform, use *on.* <br/>- We wouldn’t say "Red Hat *in* the platform enables you"—we’d say, "Red Hat *on* the platform enables you." |
