# OK

**Guidelines**  

Don't use *okay*, *ok*, *O.K.* or other variations.  

In procedures and documentation, include *select* **OK** when applicable. Don't create a separate step for *select* **OK**.  

If a procedure requires selecting OK in two dialog boxes, don't say "select **OK** twice." Instead, say "select **OK**, and then select **OK** again."  

**Examples**  
Select the checkbox next to Removable Storage Management, then select **OK**.  
When you're finished selecting colors, select **OK**, and then select **OK** again.  

In UI, donâ€™t use *OK* for a button label in an error message, where the user may not feel that the situation is OK. If the resulting action is to dismiss the message, use *Close* as the button text.
