# organization, org

An *organization* can be:

- An inclusive set of people and data being managed in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
- An entity that uses Microsoft products, technologies, or services.

Use *organization* to refer to a company, school, or nonprofit organization that's a Microsoft 365 customer (what's known inside Microsoft as a *tenant* or *directory*). Avoid using *company* for this concept because the customer could be a nonprofit or school instead. Use *tenant* only in the context of multitenant organizations.

In the UI, wherever possible, use the name of the organization rather than *Your organization.* 

Where space is limited or the term is used repeatedly, it's â€‹OK to shorten to *org,* but avoid the shortened form for less technical audiences because it sounds like jargon.

Note: The abbreviation *org* won't save space after localization.
