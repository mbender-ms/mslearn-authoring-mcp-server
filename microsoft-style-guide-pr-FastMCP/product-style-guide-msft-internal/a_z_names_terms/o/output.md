# output

In the context of generative AI, output refers to the content generated by an AI model. AI outputs can be text, an image, audio, video, or any other format.  

**Guidelines**  

Avoid. When possible, use a friendlier, more descriptive term, such as *answer*, *response*, *result*, *image*, or *content*.  

**Our style**  

Always check AI-generated content for accuracy.  

Ask the agent a question to get an AI-generated response.  

**Not our style**  

Always check AI output for accuracy.  

To generate an output, enter a prompt.
