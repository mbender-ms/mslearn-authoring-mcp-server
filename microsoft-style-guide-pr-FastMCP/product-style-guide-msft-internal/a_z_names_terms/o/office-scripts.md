# Office Scripts

A feature in Excel for the web that enables users to create, run, and record automated scripts in Excel and use them across platforms. By creating an Office Script, users can create background tasks that run automatically in the cloud and update their spreadsheet automatically, enabling information to continuously be up-to-date with no action required on the user's part. This helps users to run their businesses more efficiently anytime and anywhereâ€”without needed coding knowledge.
