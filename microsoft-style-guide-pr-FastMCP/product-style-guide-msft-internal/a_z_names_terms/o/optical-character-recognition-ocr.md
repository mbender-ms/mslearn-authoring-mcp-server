# optical character recognition (OCR)

A text recognition capability that extracts printed or handwritten text from images.

**Guidelines**

In general, spell out optical character recognition on first mention. You can use the acronym on subsequent mentions if you include it in parentheses immediately following the first mention.  
It's OK to use OCR on the first mention if the context is clear and you're sure your audience is familiar with the term.

**Examples**

Give your apps the ability to extract text from images with optical character recognition.  
Set up the optical character recognition (OCR) service for Microsoft Syntex in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
