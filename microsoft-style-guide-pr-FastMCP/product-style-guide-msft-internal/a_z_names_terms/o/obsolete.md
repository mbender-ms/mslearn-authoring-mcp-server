# obsolete

Donâ€™t use to describe products or services to an external-facing audience. It implies disuse and/or neglect.  

OK to use as an adjective (never as a verb) to describe words, phrases, documents, and policies.  

Not synonymous with *retire* or *deprecate*.

**Example**:  
An obsolete document should not be referenced if that document has been replaced by a newer document.

**See also** [retire](~\a_z_names_terms\r\retire-retired-retirement.md), [deprecate](~\a_z_names_terms\d\deprecate-deprecated.md), [end of support](~\a_z_names_terms\e\end-of-support.md)
