# Outlook

Outlook is an app that includes email, calendaring, and task management.

*Outlook*, the app, is distinct from *Outlook.com*, the free, web-based email and calendar service provider.

**Guidelines**

All mentions: Outlook

To differentiate which Outlook app is being referenced, use the following language:

- Outlook for Windows (desktop app)
- New Outlook for Windows (known internally as Monarch)
- Outlook mobile (the installed mobile app. Includes iOS and Android versions)
- Outlook for iOS
- Outlook for Android
- Outlook in a mobile browser (the web-based app in a mobile browser)
- Outlook for the web (the web-based app in a Windows or Mac browser)

**Note**: Per our brand guidelines, there are multiple ways to talk about the web-based apps that are part of Microsoft 365. In general, append one of the following phrases to the app name.

- “... on the web”
- “... for the web” 
- “... web version of...”
- “... on Microsoft365.com”
- “... in a browser”
- “... in a mobile browser” (when you need to be specific)

Don't use the following phrases for web apps:

- “Outlook Online”: This brand terminology is now retired.
- “Outlook Web App”: This causes confusion and is no longer being used externally.
- “Outlook on Office.com”: This URL was replaced by Microsoft365.com.
