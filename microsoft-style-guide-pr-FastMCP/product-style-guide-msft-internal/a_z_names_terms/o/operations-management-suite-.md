# Operations Management Suite

Operations Management Suite was retired and all the functionality is now part of the Azure portal. If you need to refer to Operations Management Suite in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Operations Management Suite

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Operations Management Suite

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
