# On-Screen Keyboard

In Windows, this is an accessibility feature that displays a graphical keyboard on the screen, which people can use with a mouse or another pointing device.

Note capitalization and hyphenation.

Don't confuse this with the "touch keyboard" that's available on PCs without a physical keyboard attached.
