# org, organization

In Dynamics 365 products and content, an organization is an entity (such as a business or company) that uses Microsoft products, technologies, or services. Don't use *organization* to refer to an *environment* or *instance.*

In all content, it's OK to use *org* as an abbreviation for *organization,* but don't use a period after the abbreviation.
