# oops

Don't use *oops* in the UI or in error messages.  

Never use *whoops.*  

**Our style**  
There's no data to show.  
That's not the right password. Try again.  
Sorry, this service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.  

**Not our style**  
Oops ... Looks like there's no data to show here.  
Oops! Did you forget how to spell?  
Oops! Our servers have fallen and they can't get up.  

**Exception**  
In some kinds of customer communications, *oops* might be OK if it is appropriate for the context and consistent with the Microsoft brand voice. Even in these situations, use *oops* only in reference to something Microsoft did, not in reference to the customerâ€™s action.
