# Operator Distributed Services

Microsoft Azure Operator Distributed Services is a “network cloud” based on Microsoft’s acquisition of AT&T’s Network Cloud Platform. The technology platform as a service enables telecom network operators, such as AT&T and Verizon, to support their 5G core network workloads on-premises and in the cloud.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Operator Distributed Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Operator Distributed Services

This name is an exception to the naming guideline to avoid including *service* in product names.

Localization is recommended for the *Operator Distributed Services* portion of the name.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
