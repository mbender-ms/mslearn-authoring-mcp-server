# Operator Connect Conferencing

Operator Connect Conferencing is a service that allows customers to configure operator dial-in phone numbers on a Microsoft Audio Conferencing bridge. Operator Connect Conferencing provides customers the ability to maintain their existing operator contracts and relationships as they migrate to the cloud, diversify their PSTN infrastructure to include multiple operators, and expand dial-in coverage and enterprise-grade reliability and support. Additionally, by launching this service we remain on-par with Zoom as they currently offer this service as well.
