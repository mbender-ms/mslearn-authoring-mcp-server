# OneDrive

OneDrive is a cloud storage service.

**Guidelines**

All mentions: OneDrive

**Exception**  
Include *Microsoft* in the app name on the first mention in third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isnâ€™t present.

One word. Note the capital *D* in the middle*.*

Consumers and business users get slightly different features in OneDrive. When you need to distinguish between them, use the following wording:

- OneDrive for home (for those with Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriptions)  
- OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business)  

Note that the descriptors (*for home*, *for work or school*) are lowercase.  

Prepositional phrases to use with OneDrive:  

- View *in* OneDrive, but View *on* OneDrive.com (if referring specifically to the web interface)  
- Save *to* OneDrive, or Save *in* OneDrive  
- Store *in* OneDrive  
- Delete *from* OneDrive
