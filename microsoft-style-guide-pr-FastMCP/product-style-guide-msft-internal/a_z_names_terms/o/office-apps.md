# Office apps

*Office apps* should only be used to refer to the apps included in one-time purchase, non-cloud-connected versions of Office, such as Office 2021 or Office LTSC.

Donâ€™t use *Office apps* when referring to the productivity apps that are included in a Microsoft 365 subscription. Call them *Microsoft 365 apps*, *apps,* or list them out individually.

**Also see** [Office to Microsoft 365 transition](~\product-and-feature-names\office-to-microsoft-365-transition.md)
