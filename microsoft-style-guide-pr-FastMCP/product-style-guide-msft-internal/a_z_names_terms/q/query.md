# query

Use as a noun to mean a set of instructions for retrieving specific data from a large set, usually with multiple conditions. Or, use as a verb to refer to running the set of instructions.

In content for the accidental admin, use *filter* instead of *query* because it's less intimidating. For an advanced audience or when the subject is advanced queries, use *query.*

When you're using it as a noun, it helps to use a clarifying verb, as in "Run query."
