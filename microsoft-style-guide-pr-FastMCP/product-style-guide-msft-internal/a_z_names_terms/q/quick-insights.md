# quick insights

In Power BI service content, use *quick insights* to refer to automatically generated insights that reveal trends and patterns in data.

Lowercase.

Don't use *Quick Insights, Auto Insights, AutoInsights,* or *scoped insights.*

Power BI Desktop uses *insights,* lowercase. The technology is the same, but the algorithms are improved.
