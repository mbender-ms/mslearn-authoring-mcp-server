# Queue Storage

An Azure service that provides messaging queues in the cloud. It is part of Azure Storage.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Queue Storage

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Queue Storage

The earlier name, *Queue service*, is still in some older reference content but should not be used in the majority of customer-facing content, especially new content.

Don’t say *Queue Storage service*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Example**

Use Azure Queue Storage to create and delete queues.
