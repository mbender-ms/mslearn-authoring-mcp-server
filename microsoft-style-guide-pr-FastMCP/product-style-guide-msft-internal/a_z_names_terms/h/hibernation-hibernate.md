# hibernation, hibernate

Hibernation is a power-saving state that saves everything in memory on disk, turns off the monitor and hard disk, and then turns off the computer. When the computer is restarted, the desktop is restored exactly as it was left.

- Use lowercase when referring to *sleep, hibernation,* and other Windows desktop power states, except when documenting UI labels.
- Avoid using *sleep, hibernation,* and *shut down* as modifiers of *state* or *mode* (for example, "sleep mode," or "the hibernation state").
- Use *hibernate* for the action that the user takes to put their computer into hibernation.
