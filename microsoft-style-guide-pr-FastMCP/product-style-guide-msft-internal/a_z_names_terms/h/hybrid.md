# hybrid

In general, a mode that combines or is in between two other modes.

Because the term *hybrid* has meaning in several different contexts, use it only as a modifier; don't use *hybrid* by itself. Always make clear what kind of hybrid you mean, such as hybrid work or hybrid cloud.

Don't refer to a user in a hybrid work scenario as a *hybrid worker*â€”that's a specific Azure role with a specific definition.
