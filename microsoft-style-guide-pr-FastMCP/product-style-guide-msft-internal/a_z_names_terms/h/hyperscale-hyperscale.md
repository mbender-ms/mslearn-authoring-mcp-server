# Hyperscale, hyperscale

Capitalize when you’re referring specifically to the Hyperscale service tier in Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure SQL Database. In general, just use *the Hyperscale service tier* or *Hyperscale.* But it’s OK to combine the service tier name to the Azure service (for example, *Azure SQL Database Hyperscale*) in marketing copy and support content to introduce the service tier or if necessary for clarity.

**Examples**  
This article provides answers to frequently asked questions for customers considering a database in the Azure SQL Database Hyperscale service tier. It describes the scenarios that Hyperscale supports and the features that are compatible with Hyperscale.

Unless you’re referring to the service tier, use *hyperscale,* lowercase, one word, and no hyphen. If possible, though, avoid this jargon and instead talk about the benefit of the technology to the customer.
