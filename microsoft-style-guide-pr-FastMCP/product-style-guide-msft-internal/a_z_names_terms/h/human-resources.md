# Human Resources

Dynamics 365 Human Resources connects people and operations data to help you optimize workforce costs and take care of your employees. Human Resources provides the workforce insights you need to build data-driven employee experiences across compensation, benefits, compliance, and other areas.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Human Resources

Don't use the former name, *Dynamics 365 Talent* or *Dynamics 365 Talent: Core HR.*

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in *Dynamics 365 for Human Resources.*

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
