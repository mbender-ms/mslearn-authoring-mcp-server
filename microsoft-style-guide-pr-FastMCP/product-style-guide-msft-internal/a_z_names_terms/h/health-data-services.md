# Health Data Services

Health Data Services is the new name for Azure Healthcare APIs.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Heath Data Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Health Data Services

This name is an exception to the naming guideline to avoid including *service* in product names.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
