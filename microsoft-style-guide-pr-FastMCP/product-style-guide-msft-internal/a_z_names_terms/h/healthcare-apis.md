# Healthcare APIs

Do not use. This name, Microsoft Azure Healthcare APIs, was replaced by Azure Health Data Services in April 2022.  
(Note: Azure Healthcare APIs replaced an earlier name, Microsoft Azure API for FHIR.)  
If you need to refer to the previous offering in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines ...

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Healthcare APIs

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Healthcare APIs

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**See** [Health Data Services](~\a_z_names_terms\h\health-data-services.md)
