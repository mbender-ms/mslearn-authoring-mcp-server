# hot desking

An office organizational system that involves multiple workers using a single physical workstation or surface during different time periods. Also, a feature of Microsoft Teams that​ allows workers to reserve a temporary workspace and access Teams on a third-party device.

- In general, write around this term, and substitute clearer phrases. For example:
  - Talk about workplaces where employees either share a desk with others or aren't assigned a permanent desk.
  - Instead of referring to the Teams feature by name, talk about how the user can reserve a temporary workspace. 

- It's OK to use *hot desking* in admin-facing content when it's necessary to help admins find related settings. 

- It's OK to include *hot desking* alongside other, more descriptive wording if necessary for SEO purposes.

- When you do use it, *hot desking* is two words, no hyphen, and lowercase. And define the term; don't assume everyone is familiar with it.

**Example**  
When the people in your company share workspaces—often called "hot desking"—it can present challenges in licensing and IT support.
