# human in the loop

Do not use. This is an outdated AI construct and terminology.  
Instead, keep humans at the center of all AI technologies. Humans are not simply “in-the-loop.” Humans are in charge; AI is “in-the-loop.”  
Any Microsoft AI-infused product should effectively communicate and collaborate with people to augment their capabilities and make their lives better and more enjoyable. Tips:

- Focus on human-centered AI by getting specific about the significant breakthrough it makes possible, or the long-perplexing challenge it helps people solve.  
- When speaking of AI more broadly, don't overpromise. Today, AI can help people automate certain key business processes or tasks. Tomorrow, it's expected to become an ambitious platform for delivering data-driven transformation and even ambient intelligence.
