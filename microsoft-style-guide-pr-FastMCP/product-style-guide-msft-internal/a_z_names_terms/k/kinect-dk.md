Azure Kinect DK is a spatial computing development kit with sophisticated computer vision and speech models, advanced AI sensors, and a range of SDKs that can be connected to Azure Cognitive Services.

First mention: Microsoft Azure Kinect DK

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Kinect DK

Don't spell out *Development Kit* in references to the name. But use *DK* only in the names of specific development kits, such as Azure Percept DK and Kinect DK. In general references, always spell out *development kit.*

Always spell out *Azure Kinect DK;* with the exception of *DK,* don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
