# kid

In Family content, use the plural form *kids* to refer to more than one child. Don’t use *children,* which sounds overly formal.

However, for the singular form, use *child* rather than *kid.*

The reason for the use of both *kids* and *child* is so that we have the flexibility to mix up the language a bit, and we don’t have sentences that say *kid* or *kids* several times and sound repetitive.
