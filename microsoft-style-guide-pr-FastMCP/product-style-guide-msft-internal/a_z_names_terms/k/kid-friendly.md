# kid-friendly

Use *kid-friendly* as a modifier when describing the appropriateness of internet content for children, such as "kid-friendly websites." Although *child-friendly* isn't inaccurate, it can seem overly formal.

Always hyphenate. But if *kid-friendly* comes after the noun that it modifies, consider different phrasing, such as "appropriate for kids."
