# Kosmos-1

Kosmos-1, a generative-AI model that can interpret images for content and context and follow instructions.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Kosmos-1

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Kosmos-1

Always include the "1" and always hyphenate *Kosmos-1*.
