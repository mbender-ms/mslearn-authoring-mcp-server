# geo

In Azure region taxonomy, geo refers to a geopolitical area. A geo signals to customers how geo-replication works, which is important for data sovereignty. Azure replicates within a geo to another region. If no region in the geo is available for replication, Azure replicates to another geo.

**Guidelines**

- Don't specify countries/regions within geos or regions unless necessary because these may change over time.
- Don't use *major region*.
- Don't capitalize *geo*.
