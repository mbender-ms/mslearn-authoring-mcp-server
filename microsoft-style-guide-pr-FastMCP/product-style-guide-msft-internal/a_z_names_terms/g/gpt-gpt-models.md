# GPT, GPT models

GPT is a generative AI term that stands for "generative pre-trained transformer." It is a series of deep learning-based language models built by OpenAI known for producing human-like output. 

OpenAI's GPT models (integrated in Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service) are a collection of generative AI models that can produce language, code, and images.

**Guidelines**

GPT (singular, do not spell out) 

In product or feature names, do not use a specific GPT model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT) 

Do not use GPT as if it were a brand as in "from GPT"  

Do not use a Microsoft brand or product name with the phrase “powered by OpenAI” such as “Power Automate powered by OpenAI” 

It's OK to use GPT, GPT model, or GPT-3.5 (or similar) when referring to the models built by OpenAI. 

It’s OK to use GPT, GPT model, or GPT-3.5 (or similar) if the app uses a GPT model as a key component of its functionality. For example, to generate natural language text such as chatbot responses, automated email messages, or social media posts. 

It's OK to use GPT to describe OpenAI-enabled functionality. For example: "Create text with GPT”

**GPT, Copilot, and generative AI are not interchangeable terms: Guidelines**

Do not use GPT as shorthand to refer to Copilot AI assistance. GPT is a specific type of generative AI and generative AI model. 

Do not use GPT as shorthand for generative AI. GPT is a specific type of generative AI, but they are not the same thing, and the terms are not interchangeable.  

GPT and generative AI have distinct meanings and refer to different things: 
- Generative AI is a broad category of AI that includes any AI system that can generate new data or content, such as text, images, or music. 
- GPT is a specific type of generative AI that uses a pre-trained neural network architecture called a transformer to generate high-quality content. But GPT is only one of many other types of generative AI such as variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) used to generate images, video, and other output.
