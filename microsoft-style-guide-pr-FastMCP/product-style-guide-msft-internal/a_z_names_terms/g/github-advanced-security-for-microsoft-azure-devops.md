# GitHub Advanced Security for Microsoft Azure DevOps

A feature that integrates and automates code scanning into the developer workflow so the risk of vulnerabilities is minimized before the build reaches production.  

**Guidelines**

First mention: GitHub Advanced Security for Microsoft Azure DevOps  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps  

Title-cased and the name is to be localized in all instances.  

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
