# generate

In the context of generative AI, the term *generate* is used to describe the process used by a computer to create something automatically.  

**Guidelines**  

Do not use *generate* to describe user/customer behaviors, actions, goals, or intent. Instead use conversational verbs, such as *make, write, draw, etc*. See list below for more options.  

Avoid using *generate* to describe AI system behaviors when possible. Instead, use terms that more accurately describe the process, such as *create, summarize, sketch, etc.* See list below for more options.  

It’s OK to use the term *generate* in cases where you need to refer to all the types of content that AI can create or when a specific term would be too limiting.  

When writing about people using AI tools, it’s OK to use the term *generate* to describe and AI behavior when it’s the most clear and conversational solution. Follow the format “to generate a [thing]”.  

**Example**  

You can use Microsoft Designer to generate variations based on a starter image.  

Avoid the term *generate* in chat responses or output. Chat responses should sound natural and use plain language.  

**Conversational verbs and descriptive terms:**  

- make  
- create  
- write  
- draft  
- edit  
- design  
- draw  
- sketch  
- set up  
- build  
- start  
- refine  
- compose  
- summarize  
- synthesize  
- produce
