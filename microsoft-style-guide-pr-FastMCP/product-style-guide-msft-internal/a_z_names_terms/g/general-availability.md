# general availability

Refers to a stable and production-ready product or service that is publicly available to all customers and backed by SLA guarantees.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase. 
- It’s OK to use *general availability* in formal references to a product or service becoming publicly available, such as in announcements, terms of use, and explanations of support models. Otherwise, try to use more casual, friendlier language, such as *available to the public.*
- It’s OK to use *GA* sparingly after the full term has been spelled out and the acronym introduced. Use *GA* only to mean *general availability.* Don’t use it as an abbreviation for similar terms like *generally available.*
- Don't include *GA* in product names.
