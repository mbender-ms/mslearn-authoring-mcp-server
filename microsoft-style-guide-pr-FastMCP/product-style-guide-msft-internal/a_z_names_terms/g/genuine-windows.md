# genuine Windows

A copy of Windows that is published by Microsoft, properly licensed, and fully supported by Microsoft.

Genuine Windows is a recurring process that checks a product key to make sure it's not blocked or being used on hardware that's different from what was used to activate Windows. If the product key is found to be nongenuine, it's likely either being used on another computer or is counterfeit. The genuine, or validation, check is performed when a computer attempts to download optional updates from Microsoft.
