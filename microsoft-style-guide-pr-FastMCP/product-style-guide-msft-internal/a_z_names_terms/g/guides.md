# Guides

Use Dynamics 365 Guides to create in-context work instructions for workers equipped with HoloLens. First-line workers can use these step-by-step holographic guides to stay heads-up and hands-free as they complete everyday tasks (training, assembly, and maintenance).

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Guides

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
