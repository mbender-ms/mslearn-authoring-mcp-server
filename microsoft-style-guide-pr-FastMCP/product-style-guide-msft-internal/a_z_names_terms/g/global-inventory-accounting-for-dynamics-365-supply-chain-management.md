**Guidelines**

First mention: Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Global Inventory Accounting for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Global Inventory Accounting

Don't refer to Global Inventory Accounting as an app.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
