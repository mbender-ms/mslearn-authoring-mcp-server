# grounding

In the context of generative AI, *grounding* refers to the process of providing resources to give the language model context—beyond its training data—to inform its output. LLMs can be grounded on a system level or on a user level. It’s important to note that an LLM’s grounded responses may also include responses that are factually incorrect or incoherent.  

The terms *grounded response* and *grounding* are most commonly used within the developer community and may not be well understood beyond a technical audience.  

**Guidelines**  

Avoid. If possible, use a more customer-friendly term such as context, information, sources, or resources.  
 
Don’t use in UI.  
 
It’s OK to use the term *web-grounded* to describe Microsoft Copilot.  
 
If necessary, OK to use when writing for a technical audience.  

**Examples**  

Connect data sources to ground your copilot or agent with domain-specific context and improve accuracy.  
 
Microsoft Copilot is a web-grounded chat experience with enterprise data protection.  
 
Consider grounding your prompt with files or other resources to improve accuracy.
