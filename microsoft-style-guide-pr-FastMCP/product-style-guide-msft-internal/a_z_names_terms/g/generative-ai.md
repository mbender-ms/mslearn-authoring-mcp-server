# generative AI

Generative AI can produce new content based on what is described in the input: content, code, images, speech, video, 3D, and more.

But the technology underlying the creation of all these formats is the same: Generative AI works by using deep learning to build models from a given set of training data. These models are trained to recognize patterns in the data and then generate new data based on those patterns. Generative AI also has a feedback loop that allows models to be updated as new data is generated and used, meaning they are gradually improved. Example models: GPT-3.5 and Stable Diffusion.

**Guidelines**

*generative AI*

Lowercase

In general, focus on what users and customers can do, rather than the enabling technology, as in "Create blog posts, social media copy, emails, and more." 

Use *generative AI* to refer to the technology category when needed. (Don't substitute the terms *Large Language Models, LLMs,* or *GPT* as those are only elements of generative AI.)

**Examples**

"Analytical AI or traditional AI is for analyzing a set of data to find patterns for a multitude of use cases. In contrast, Copilot’s generative AI is for creating something new—helping billions of workers doing knowledge work and creative work."

**Generative AI terminology: GPT, Copilot, generative AI**

The terms *GPT, Copilot,* and *generative AI* are not interchangeable:

- Do not use GPT as shorthand to refer to Copilot AI assistance. GPT is a specific type of generative AI and generative AI model.

- Do not use GPT as shorthand for generative AI. GPT is a specific type of generative AI, but they are not exactly the same thing and the terms are not interchangeable. *GPT* and *generative AI* have distinct meanings and refer to different things:

  - Generative AI is a broad category of AI that includes any AI system that can generate new data or content, such as text, images, or music.

  - GPT is a specific type of generative AI that uses a pre-trained neural network architecture called a transformer to generate high-quality content. But GPT is only one of many other types of generative AI such as variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) used to generate images, video, and other output.
