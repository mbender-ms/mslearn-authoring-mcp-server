# + (plus sign)

Instead of the ampersand (&), Microsoft style is to use the plus sign (+). The plus sign and the minus sign (−) are mathematical symbols meaning "more" and "less," respectively. Their use has been extended to many other meanings, more or less analogous.

Microsoft uses the plus sign in the design of logotypes, titles, and product and program names. Exception: If the ampersand part of a company’s formal name or title of a published work, use the ampersand instead of writing out the word “and" or using the plus sign. For example, “AT&T” or "Eats, Shoots & Leaves."

**Guidelines**

The plus sign can be used to mean _and, plus,_ or _over_

- And: When the plus sign is used for the word _and_ put a space on both sides of the plus sign, as in "Keynotes + breakout sessions." 
- Over: When + is used for the word _over_, only put a space after the plus sign, as in "100+ templates."
- Plus: When + is used for the word plus, only put a space after the plus sign, as in "Who+."

It's OK to use a plus sign instead of the word "and" in the following places:

- Titles, headings, subheadings, column headings, labels, menu items, and similar strings
- In product and program names, use the plus sign. Examples: Enterprise Mobility + Security, Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations.

Avoid using a plus sign instead of the word "and" in body text—including messages, notifications, and info bubbles—unless space constraints require it

- Don’t use a plus sign every time you want to represent the word “and."
- Don’t use the plus sign as a replacement for “and” in regular text, headings, and titles unless space is a constraint.
- In narrative copy (sentences) and when in doubt, err on the side of using the word _and_ instead of the plus sign. 

When referring to the plus sign itself (as a symbol), use "the plus sign" instead of "the plus icon."
