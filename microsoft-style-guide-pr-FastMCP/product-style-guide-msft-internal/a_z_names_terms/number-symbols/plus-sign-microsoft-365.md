# + (plus sign) (Microsoft 365)

Donâ€™t use to indicate the word *and* or in place of an ampersand (&), unless the plus sign (+) is part of a specific brand name, such as Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security. For more info, see [& (ampersand)](~\a_z_names_terms\number-symbols\ampersand-microsoft-365.md).

When the plus sign is a part of the UI, as in keyboard shortcuts, write it this way:

To open Magnifier, press the **Windows logo key** [glyph] + **Plus sign** (**+**).

Note:

- The parentheses aren't bold, but the plus sign inside the parentheses is bold.
- The plus sign that isn't part of the UI isn't bold.
- See also [Keys and keyboard shortcuts](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/keys-keyboard-shortcuts) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

It's OK to use the plus sign to indicate that something is over a certain number.
