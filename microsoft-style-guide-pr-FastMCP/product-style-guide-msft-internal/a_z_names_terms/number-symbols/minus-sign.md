# - (minus sign)

When the minus sign (-) is a part of the UI, as in keyboard shortcuts, write it this way:

To collapse the selected folder, press **Num lock** + **Minus sign** (**-**).

- The parentheses aren't bold, but the minus sign inside the parentheses is bold.
- The plus sign that isn't part of the UI isn't bold.
