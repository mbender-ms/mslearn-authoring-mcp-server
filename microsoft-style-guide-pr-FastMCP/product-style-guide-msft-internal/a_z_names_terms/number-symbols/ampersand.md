# & (ampersand)

The Cloud + AI group uses the plus sign (+) rather than the ampersand (&) in the UI.

The Microsoft 365, Security, and Windows group uses the ampersand (&) in the UI.

**Guidelines**

Use _&_ (ampersand) in the UI for the titles of categories, pivot headings, tiles, and so on (for example, in system settings and PC settings).

Put a space on either side of the _&_.

Use _and_ in dialog box titles and other dialog box UI unless you're extremely short on space.

Use _and_ in running text, in the titles of help and web content, and almost all other places. In other words, don’t start using & instead of and everywhere. When in doubt, err on the side of using the word and instead of &.

Don’t use the plus sign (+) unless it's part of a specific name, such as Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security.
