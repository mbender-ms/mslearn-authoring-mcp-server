# @mention

OK to use as a noun to mean a mention of a person or team, preceded by the at sign (@), that sends them a notification to get their attention.

Also OK to use as a verb meaning to type @ before someone's name to get their attention in a message or conversation.

There's no space between @ and *mention.*

**Examples**  
Invite people to learn about saving and sharing files in the cloud, co-authoring in real time, and collaborating with @mentions.  
To be more casual, delete everything except the person's first name in the @mention.  
Notifications let you know when someone @mentions you.  
Start a new conversation. Type @ to mention someone. [*in Microsoft Teams UI*]
