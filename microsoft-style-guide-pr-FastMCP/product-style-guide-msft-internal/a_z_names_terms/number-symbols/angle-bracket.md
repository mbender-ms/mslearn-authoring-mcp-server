# (angle bracket)

**Guidelines**

Use the right angle brackets (>) in procedures and UI to indicate the path through a series of menus.  
Include a space before and after. Don't make the brackets bold.  
Use this approach only when there’s a clear and obvious path through the UI, when you believe that the person won't be confused about what to select, and when the method of selection doesn't differ between the steps. That is, don’t mix things that require clicking or tapping with things that require a right-click or pressing and holding.

**Example**

Select **Start** **Settings** **Connections**

In procedures, include the glyph that matches the preceding word when available. 

**Example**  

Select **Start** [glyph] **Settings** [glyph] **System** [glyph] > *Notifications* [glyph]

Use right angle brackets in UI when showing a “breadcrumb” path from the main page of a website to the subpages below it. 

**Example** 

Home Users Deleted users

Note that the right angle bracket is also known as the "greater than symbol," and some screen readers read it that way. When using angle brackets, provide ARIA or alternative text that spells out what this means.
