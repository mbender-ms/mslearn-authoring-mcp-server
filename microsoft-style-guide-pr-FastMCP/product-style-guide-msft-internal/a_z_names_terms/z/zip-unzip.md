# zip, unzip

Use *zip* and *unzip* when you're referring to .zip files because that's the language that customers use themselves.

Include *compress* or *extract* in parentheses where space permits because it's descriptive and helpful if customers are unfamiliar with the concept.

Don't use *zip* and *unzip* when you're referring to other compression or archive formats.

**Examples**  
You can zip (compress) a file so that it takes up less space.  
You can unzip (extract) files or folders from a compressed folder.
