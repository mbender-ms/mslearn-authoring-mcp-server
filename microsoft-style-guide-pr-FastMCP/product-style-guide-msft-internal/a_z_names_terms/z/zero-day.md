# zero-day

A type of vulnerability that hasn't been patched by the software vendor, or an exploit that takes advantage of that vulnerability.

For clarity and if space allows, try to have a noun following *zero-day,* such as in "zero-day vulnerability" or "zero-day exploit."

Lowercase. Always hyphenate.
