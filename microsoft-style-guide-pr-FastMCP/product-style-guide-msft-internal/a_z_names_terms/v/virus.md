# virus

A virus is a specific type of malware that replicates, commonly by infecting other files in the system, thus allowing the execution of the malware code and its propagation when those files are activated.

In general, use *malware* to refer to malicious code. Use *virus* only when youâ€™re referring to a specific virus.
