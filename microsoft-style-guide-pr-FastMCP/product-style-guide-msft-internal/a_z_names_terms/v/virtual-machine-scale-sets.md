# Virtual Machine Scale Sets

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets is an Azure compute resource that you can use to create and manage a group of heterogeneous load-balanced virtual machines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Virtual Machine Scale Sets

Always spell out the name. Don't use *VMSS, VM Scale Sets,* or any other abbreviation or acronym. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Capitalize *Virtual Machine Scale Sets* only when referring to the Azure service. When you're referring generically to a type of technology, use lowercase *virtual machine scale sets* or *scale sets.*
