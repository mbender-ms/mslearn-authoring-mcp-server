# VPN Gateway

VPN Gateway enables you to establish secure, cross-premises connectivity between your virtual network within Azure and your on-premises IT infrastructure.  

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure VPN Gateway
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: VPN Gateway
- In references to the Azure service, always use the acronym *VPN;* don't spell out *virtual private network.* Lowercase when referring to an instance/output of using the service: a VPN gateway.
