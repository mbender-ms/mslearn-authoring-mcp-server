# "View all" and similar phrases

Phrases like *View all, See also,* and *Watch it later* are fine to use, as long as theyâ€™re being used in inoffensive contexts that otherwise support accessibility. The problem is when we use that language and then fail to provide a way for the person to consume the content.

See the [Accessibility](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2696&topicid=28077) topic for more information about creating products and content are accessible to people of all abilities.
