# virtual machine

The software implementation of a computer that emulates a physical machine, runs an operating system, and is hosted in Azure.

**Guidance**

- Lowercase.
- It’s acceptable to abbreviate *virtual machine* to *VM* on subsequent mentions. However, don’t use *VM* in situations where it could be confused with the product name (Virtual Machines) or with virtual memory.
