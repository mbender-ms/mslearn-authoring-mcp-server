# vcpkg

A cross-platform, command-line package manager for C and C++ libraries, vcpkg simplifies the acquisition and installation of third-party libraries on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**Guidelines**

- All mentions: vcpkg
- Always use lowercase for *vcpkg.* Donâ€™t capitalize *vcpkg* if it appears at the beginning of a sentence or other text string. Instead, rewrite to avoid having a lowercase letter at the beginning.
