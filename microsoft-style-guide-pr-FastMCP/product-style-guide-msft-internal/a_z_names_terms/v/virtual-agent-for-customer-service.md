# Virtual Agent for Customer Service

Be careful to use the correct name.

Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service is one package that combines Power Virtual Agents and Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights, enabling customer service teams to easily identify and automate common support issues by using intelligent chatbots—all without having to write code.

Before November 2019, *Dynamics 365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service* was the name used for the app now called *Power Virtual Agents.* For guidelines for referring to the Power Virtual Agents app, see [Power Virtual Agents](~\a_z_names_terms\p\power-virtual-agents.md).
