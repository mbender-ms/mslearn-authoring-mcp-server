# Virtual Network Manager

Azure Virtual Network Manager is a management service that enables customers to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual network constructs globally across subscriptions, instead of managing them manually or individually.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Manager

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Virtual Network Manager

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
