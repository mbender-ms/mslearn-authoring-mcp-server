# Visual Studio Code

A lightweight, source-code editor that runs on a desktop and is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**Guidelines**

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Visual Studio name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

First mention: Microsoft Visual Studio Code  
Subsequent mentions: VS Code

*Visual Studio Code* and *VS Code* are trademarks. Don't shorten the name to *VSC* or any other an acronym or abbreviation

If referring to [*Visual Studio*](~\a_z_names_terms\v\visual-studio.md) always spell out the name; don't shorten the name to *VS* or any other an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
