# visual, visualization

A visual depiction of data used to communicate meaning and enable discovery of patterns and insights in the data.

In Power BI, *visualization* and *visual* are interchangeable.Â 

The shared reporting canvas container for choosing a visual is called the *Visualizations pane*.
