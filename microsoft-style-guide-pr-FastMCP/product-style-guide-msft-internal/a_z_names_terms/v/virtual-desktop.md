# Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud. Azure Virtual Desktop replaced Windows Virtual Desktop in June 2021.

**Guidelines**

All mentions: Azure Virtual Desktop

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Because virtual desktop is also an indusrty term, always include *Azure* when referring to the service. 

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
