# Video Analyzer

Azure Video Analyzer was an AI service that enabled developers to quickly build a video-analytics solution to extract insights from all video assets, whether stored or streaming.

**Note:** Azure Video Analyzer will reach end of life on November 30, 2022, and customers are advised to transition off of Video Analyzer by then. For details, see [Transition from Video Analyzer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/transition-from-video-analyzer).

If you need to refer to Video Analyzer in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Video Analyzer

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Video Analyzer

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
