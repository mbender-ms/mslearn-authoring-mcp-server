# virtual agent

For general guidelines for the term *virtual agent,* see [AI and bot terms](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/ai-bot-terms) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide.*

For clarity and to avoid confusing customers, don't use *virtual agent* unless it's necessaryâ€”for example, because the product name includes *virtual agent.* Instead, use *bot* or *chatbot* as appropriate.

Rationale: Some customers are confused about whether a "virtual agent" is a human or a bot, and some people use *virtual agent* to refer to virtual assistants like Cortana and Siri.
