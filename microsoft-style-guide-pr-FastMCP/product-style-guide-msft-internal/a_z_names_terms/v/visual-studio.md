# Visual Studio

**Guidelines**

For all Visual Studio names shown below, you can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Visual Studio name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

*Visual Studio* is a trademark. Don't shorten it to *VS.*
