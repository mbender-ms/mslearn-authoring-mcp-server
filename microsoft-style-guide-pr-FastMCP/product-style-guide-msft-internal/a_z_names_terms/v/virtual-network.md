# Virtual Network

Azure Virtual Network is the networking service that customers use to create and manage virtual private networks in Azure and securely link those networks to other virtual networks or their own on-premises networking infrastructure.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Virtual Network
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Virtual Network
- A *virtual network* is an instance of the Virtual Network service that consists of a custom virtual private network running in Azure and optionally other connected VPNs and on-premises networks. Lowercase when referring to an individual instance: *An Azure virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud.*
- Don't use *vNet*, *Vnet,* or *VNET* as an abbreviation. In technical documentation, you can use *VNet* as part of an example name for a virtual network created by the Virtual Network service. For example, *MyVNet1*, *MyVNet2*.
- Avoid *VNet-to-VNet*. One acceptable alternative is *network-to-network*, if it's clear that you're talking about virtual networks.
