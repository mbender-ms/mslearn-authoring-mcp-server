# Video Indexer

Azure Video Indexer, part of Azure Applied AI Services, enables customers to extract insights from their videos.  
Video Indexer was briefly called *Azure Video Analyzer for Media,* but in April 2022, the name reverted to *Video Indexer.*

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Video Indexer  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Video Indexer  
Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
