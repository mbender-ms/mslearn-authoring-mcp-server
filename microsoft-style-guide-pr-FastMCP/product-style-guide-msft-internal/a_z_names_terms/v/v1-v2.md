# V1, V2

Don't use to refer to Resource Manager, the classic deployment model, or Azure resources like virtual machines.

**Why**:

- Resource Manager is a trademarked name with major marketing investment.
- Versioning our services and related technologies is largely irrelevant and sends the wrong message since these technologies are updated continually.
