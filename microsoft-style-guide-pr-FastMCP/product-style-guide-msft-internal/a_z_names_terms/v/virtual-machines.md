# Virtual Machines

The Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offer that customers use to deploy persistent virtual machines with nearly any server workload that they want.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Virtual Machines
  - Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
  - Lowercase when referring to an instance created using the service: virtual machine
