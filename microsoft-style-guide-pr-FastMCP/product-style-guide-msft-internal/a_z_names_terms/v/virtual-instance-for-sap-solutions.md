Azure Virtual Instance for SAP solutions is an Azure service that resides within Azure Center for SAP solutions. Customers will use Virtual Instance for SAP solutions to create and manage their SAP systems and virtual machines.

First mention: Microsoft Azure Virtual Instance for SAP solutions  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.  

- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Virtual Instance for SAP solutions  

Note that the word *solutions* in *SAP solutions* is lowercase. This is the style preferred by SAP.  

Always spell out the name; with the exception of *SAP,* don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
