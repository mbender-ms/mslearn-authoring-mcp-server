# Azure Managed Grafana

Azure Managed Grafana is a Microsoft service that integrates Grafana with Azure and is hosted on Azure. The name *Azure Managed Grafana* replaces the earlier name, *Azure Managed Workspace for Grafana.*

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Managed Grafana
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Azure Managed Grafana
- Don't use the previously approved name, *Azure Managed Workspace for Grafana.*
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
