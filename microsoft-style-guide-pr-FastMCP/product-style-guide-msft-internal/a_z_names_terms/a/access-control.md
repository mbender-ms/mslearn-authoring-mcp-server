# Access Control

Access Control was retired in November 2018.  

The Azure Active Directory service that provides federated authentication and rules-driven, claims-based authorization for REST web services. It provides an easy way of authenticating application users without having to code complex authentication logic.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Access Control service
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Access Control
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
