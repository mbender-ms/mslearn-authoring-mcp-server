# Azure Verified Modules

Azure Verified Modules are infrastructure-as-code modules that have been tested and verified to ensure they codify Microsoft guidance.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Verified Modules

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies: 

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface. 
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name. 

Subsequent mentions: Azure Verified Modules 

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service. 

Localize on all markets. 

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
