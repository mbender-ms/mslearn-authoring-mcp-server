# app

Use in place of *program* or *application* in all new content.

In changes to or additions to legacy content, use whatever is best for the situation, depending on the level of change, dependencies, and possible side effects. 

Donâ€™t mix *app* and *program* on the same surface.

When referring to an app, use just its name (*Open File Explorer*) or use an article (*Download the Visio Viewer app*) as appropriate.
