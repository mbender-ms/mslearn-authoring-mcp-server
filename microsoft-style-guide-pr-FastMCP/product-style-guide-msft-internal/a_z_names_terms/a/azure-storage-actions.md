# Azure Storage Actions

Azure Storage Actions is a new serverless product that enables users to perform common data management, protection, and security operations on millions of objects across multiple storage accounts with a focus on blobs.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Storage Actions

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Storage Actions
