# admin center (Microsoft 365)

A web-based management portal for administrators of a service or set of services.

- Lowercase *admin center,* even when the term is preceded by *Microsoft 365* or any other brand.

- When the context is clear (for example, within Microsoft 365 admin center UI), it's OK to use *admin center* by itself to refer to Microsoft 365 admin center. When you use *admin center* alone, include *the,* as in *the admin center.*

- Use *admin center* for the name of the whole site. Use *home* to refer to the dashboard page on that site. Avoid *portal* and *dashboard.*

**Examples**  
Microsoft 365 admin center [*in the header*]  
Device Management is the name of another admin center.  
Go to the admin center home page.
