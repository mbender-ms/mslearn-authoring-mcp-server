# allotment

A limited number of licenses that you separate from your organization's full license inventory to be managed by a security group. Theyâ€™ll only have access to manage the licenses within the allotment and can't access the rest of the licenses that your organization owns.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase
- Do not use the terms *ringfence*, *license management units* (or *LMU*), or *allotment pools*. Always use *allotment* instead.
