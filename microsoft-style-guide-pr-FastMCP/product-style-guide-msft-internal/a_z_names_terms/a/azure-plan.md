# Azure plan

An Azure plan gives a customer access to Azure services at pay-as-you-go rates under the Microsoft Customer Agreement. It functions differently depending on purchase method.

**Customer-led:** When a customer creates an account under the Microsoft Customer Agreement, they automatically get an Azure plan. A customer doesn’t sign up for or buy an Azure plan explicitly. The Azure plan simply determines the pricing a customer receives.

**Field-led:** Sellers include the Azure plan in the customer’s proposal. Upon the customer’s acceptance of the proposal and the Microsoft Customer Agreement, the customer gets a billing account with an Azure plan. The Azure plan determines the pricing a customer receives.

**Partner-led:** Partners gain access to the full catalog of Azure products and services via the Azure plan at pay-as-you-go rates. Each customer gets assigned an Azure plan, which can have one or many subscriptions within. A customer has to sign a Microsoft Customer Agreement to be assigned an Azure plan.

**Guidelines**

* Use _Azure plan_. Don't capitalize plan.

* A customer doesn't purchase or sign up for an Azure plan.
