# Azure Synapse Pathway

Azure Synapse Pathway is a free, downloadable tool that simplifies and accelerates data warehouse migration by automating the critical tasks of scanning, assessing, and translating existing SQL code in minutes to be optimized for Azure Synapse Analytics.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Synapse Pathway

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Synapse Pathway

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
