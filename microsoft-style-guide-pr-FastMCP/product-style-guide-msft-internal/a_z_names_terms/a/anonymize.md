# anonymize

To remove direct and indirect personal identifiers from data such that it can never be re-identified.

*De-identify* and *anonymize* are not synonyms. They have distinct meanings with legal implications in privacy scenarios.  

Anonymization of personal data is a subcategory of de-identification, wherein direct and indirect personal identifiers are removed, and data can never be re-identified. Anonymization is a data processing technique that removes or modifies personally identifiable information; it results in anonymized data that can't be associated with any one individual.
