# Azure Compute Fleet

Azure Compute Fleet is a service that simplifies the provisioning of Azure compute capacity across different virtual machine types, availability zones, and pricing models.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Azure Compute Fleet  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Compute Fleet  

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
