# Artifact Registry

Microsoft Artifact Registry, formerly known as Microsoft Container Registry, is the primary registry for all Microsoft-published container images. A service that provides the distribution of official Microsoft artifacts, such as container images for all customers. Because it’s cross-portfolio, it’s Microsoft-branded, not Azure-branded.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Artifact Registry

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Artifact Registry

Don’t include *Azure*.

Lowercase when referring to an instance of using the service: *container registry*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Also see** [Azure Container Registry](~/a_z_names_terms/a/azure-container-registry.md)
