# Admin (Microsoft 365)

Admin is a Microsoft-created app within the Teams client that contains functionality from both the Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers. It allows people with admin roles to manage users, subscriptions, and org-wide settings without leaving Teams.

Outside of Microsoft Teams product UI, modify this name with the phrase "for Microsoft Teams" to differentiate it from other types of apps (web or mobile).
