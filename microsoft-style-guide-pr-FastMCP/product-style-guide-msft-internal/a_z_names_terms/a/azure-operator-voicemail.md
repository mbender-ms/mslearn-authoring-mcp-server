# Azure Operator Voicemail

A product that allows operators to provide voicemail services to their fixed and mobile subscribers.  

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Operator Voicemail  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Azure Operator Voicemail, Operator Voicemail  

Title cased, localize in all markets.
