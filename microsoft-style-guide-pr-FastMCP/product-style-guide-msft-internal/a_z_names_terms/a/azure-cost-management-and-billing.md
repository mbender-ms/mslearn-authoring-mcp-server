# Azure Cost Management and Billing

The name of this service changed to Microsoft Cost Management. If you need to refer to Azure Cost Management and Billing in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Cost Management and Billing

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Cost Management and Billing

When it's appropriate for your content, include a reference to the current name.

**Example**  
Azure Cost Management and Billing (now known as Microsoft Cost Management) .…

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
