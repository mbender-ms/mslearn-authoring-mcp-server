# availability zone

**Guidelines**

Lowercase.  

You can use a phrase like *Azure availability zone* if you need to establish that the context is Azure, but don’t capitalize *Azure Availability Zones,* which makes it seem like it’s a product.  

**Our style**  

An availability zone is a physically and logically separated Azure datacenter that has its own independent power source, network, and cooling. Connected with an extremely low-latency network, Azure availability zones help deliver high-availability applications. Availability zones ensure that if there's an event that affects a datacenter site, your data will be protected.
