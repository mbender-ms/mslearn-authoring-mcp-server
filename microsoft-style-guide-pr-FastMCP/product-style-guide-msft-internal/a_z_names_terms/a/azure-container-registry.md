# Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry is a private registry for hosting container images. Not to be confused with Microsoft Container Registry (now called Microsoft Artifact Registry)

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Container Registry

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Container Registry

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see Acronyms + abbreviations.

Lowercase when referring to an instance of using the service: *container registry*.
