# Azure App Protect

Azure App Protect is a protection product which integrates network and application protections together into a single offering. App Protect will allow customers to deploy protection for inbound attacks against applications without knowing which Azure products to use and where to use them.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Microsoft Azure App Protect  

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Azure App Protect
