# add, create

When to use *Add* vs. *Create* as a command in product UI:

Use *add* to describe adding an existing object to a container or collection; use *create* for objects that don't exist yet. For example, you "add" a website to favorites, but you "create" a policy. As a button label, pair the verb with a direct or indirect object, for example, "Add contact," "Add to group," "Add email," etc.
