Album Creator is a Microsoft Designer feature and a mini app that uses AI to create photo albums from a customer's photos.

All mentions: Album Creator  

Unbranded, title-cased  

Outside of Microsoft Designer product UI or other pages clearly branded for Designer, use "from Designer" or "from Microsoft Designer" to clarify the branding.

**Example**  

Turn photos into memories. Upload your photos and Album Creator will use AI to create a custom photo album filled with graphics and animations for you to share.
