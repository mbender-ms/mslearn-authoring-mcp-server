# API Apps, API app

Feature of Azure [App Service](~\a_z_names_terms\a\app-service.md) used to build and consume cloud APIs. The generic term, _API apps (or APIs),_ should be used when referring to apps made using the API Apps feature or another technology/tool.

**Guidelines**

First mention: API Apps feature of Microsoft Azure App Service

You can omit _Microsoft_ if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word _Microsoft_ has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: API Apps

Don't refer to this feature as _Azure API Apps_.

Lowercase when referring to an instance of (something built using) the service: API app, API apps  

**Examples**  
We've used the API Apps feature of Azure App Service to build and deploy several API apps.  
My team built an API app at the hackathon.  
5 web apps, 3 mobile apps, and 12 API apps _[in UI]_
