# Azure customer care credit

Azure customer care credit, formerly Azure Service Credit, is a type of credit issued by the Azure Business Operations team for goodwill, overbilling, and pricing issues.  

**Guidelines**  

- Use only in the customer experience (for example, in the Azure portal) for customers with this type of credit.  
- Don’t use in marketing or external materials such as Azure.com pages, ACOM, documentation, or readiness materials, etc.  
- Don't capitalize *customer care credit*.
