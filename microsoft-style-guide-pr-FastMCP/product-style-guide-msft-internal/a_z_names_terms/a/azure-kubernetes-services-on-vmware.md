# Azure Kubernetes Services on VMware

Azure Kubernetes Services on VMware is a product that extends the capabilities of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to customers’ on-premises vSphere environment.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Services on VMware
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: AKS on VMware
- We typically don't use acronyms for product names, but AKS is a legally approved exception.
- Don't abbreviate *Kubernetes* to *K8s* or similar.
