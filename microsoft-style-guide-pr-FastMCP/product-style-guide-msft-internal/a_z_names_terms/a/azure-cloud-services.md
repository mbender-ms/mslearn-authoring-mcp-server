# Azure Cloud Services

Azure Cloud Services is our platform-as-a-service offering that customers use to build powerful, scalable web applications without having to manage the underlying platform.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Cloud Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name. 

Subsequent mentions: Azure Cloud Services

Always use *Azure* to identify the service name as an Azure service and distinguish it from generic references to cloud services.

Lowercase when referring to an instance built by using Azure Cloud Services: *cloud service*.
