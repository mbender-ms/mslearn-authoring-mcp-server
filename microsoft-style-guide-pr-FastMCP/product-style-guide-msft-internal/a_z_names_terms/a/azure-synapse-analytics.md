# Azure Synapse Analytics

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Azure Synapse Analytics  

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.  

Localize on all markets.  

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
