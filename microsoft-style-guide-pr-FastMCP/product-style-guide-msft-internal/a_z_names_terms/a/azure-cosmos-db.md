# Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a fast NoSQL database with open APIs for any scale.

**Name guidelines for Azure Cosmos DB**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Cosmos DB

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

To refer to an instance of this product, use *database* or *container*. If you need to specify the product, don't use *Azure Cosmos DB database* or *Azure Cosmos DB* *container*. Instead, use "a database created with Azure Cosmos DB" or similar.
