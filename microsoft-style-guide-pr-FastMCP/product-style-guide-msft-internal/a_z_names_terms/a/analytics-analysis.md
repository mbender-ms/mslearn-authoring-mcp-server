# analytics, analysis

Use _analytics_ and _insights_ appropriately.

In the context of business, customers expect apps that provide analysis to give them clarity of their data and the other various things they're measuring. Insights are the next level that good analysis should provide.

Simply put: _Analysis_ leads to clarity of data (like dashboards). _Insights_ lead to concrete advice (AI-infused reasoning of data).

The burden of proof for whether something can be called "insights" and not just "analytics" is that the app/product:

- Must be built on AI. 
- Must provide more than inert analysis, but also actionable intelligence, concrete suggestions, or both.
