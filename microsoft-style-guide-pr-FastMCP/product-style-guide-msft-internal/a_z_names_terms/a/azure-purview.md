# Azure Purview

As of April 2022, *Azure Purview* was replaced by *Microsoft Purview.* For guidelines, see [Microsoft Purview](~\a_z_names_terms\m\microsoft-purview\microsoft-purview.md). 

If you need to refer to Azure Purview in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Purview

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Purview

Always include *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**See** [Microsoft Purview](~\a_z_names_terms\m\microsoft-purview\microsoft-purview.md)
