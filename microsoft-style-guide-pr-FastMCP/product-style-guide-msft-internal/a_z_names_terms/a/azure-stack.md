# Azure Stack

Azure Stack is a portfolio of products that extends Azure services and capabilities to your environment of choice—from the datacenter to edge locations and remote offices.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Stack

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Stack

Always include *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

When the name appears by itself (as a noun), don’t precede it with “the.” But if the name functions as an adjective, the name can be preceded by “the.”
