# Azure Spring Apps

Microsoft Azure Spring Apps is a fully managed platform as a service for running Spring Boot applications at cloud scale.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Spring Apps

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Spring Apps

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Don't use the previous name, *Azure Spring Cloud.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
