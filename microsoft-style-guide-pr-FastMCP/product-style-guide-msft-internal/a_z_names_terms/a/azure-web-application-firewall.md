# Azure Web Application Firewall

Azure Web Application Firewall is a cloud-native web application firewall service that provides centralized protection for web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities.
 
**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Web Application Firewall

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Web Application Firewall

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name. Don't use the acronym *WAF* when referring to the product. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

The term *web application firewall* (lowercase) can also refer to the technology generally. When you're referring to the technology—not the product—you can use the acronym *WAF* if:

- You have spelled out the full term on first mention and included the acronym in parenthesis after: web application firewall (WAF).
- It's clear from context that you're referring to the technology and not the product.
