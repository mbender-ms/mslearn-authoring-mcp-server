# Azure Voice Bridge

A voice networking service that allows telecom operators to connect their operations support and business support systems with Microsoft Teams and other call control platforms.  

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Voice Bridge

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mention: Azure Voice Bridge

Title-cased and the name is to be localized in all instances.  

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
