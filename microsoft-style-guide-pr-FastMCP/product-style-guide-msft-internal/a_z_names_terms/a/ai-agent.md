# AI agent

Use the term *agent* not *AI agent* unless it’s explicitly necessary to differentiate from other types of agents, like in client/server applications and for humans who work in customer service. Use "agent" on its own if the context of AI is clear.

An *AI agent*, or agentic system, completes jobs and tasks with some autonomy alongside or on behalf of a person, team, or organization. It responds to user requests and system events by pairing data and code with an AI language model.

AI agents:

- Operate over a defined domain, whether narrow or broad.
- Vary in autonomy from simply assisting with tasks to eventually completing tasks without human involvement.
- Have some ability to incorporate context into their processing, ultimately through memory and learning from interactions with people and events.
- Can operate alone in a system or with other agents in a multi-agent system.
- Can have user-facing elements or operate entirely in the background.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase *agent* in general references
- Don’t call them *Copilot agents*, *extensions*, or *copilots*
- Don't directly or indirectly suggest that an AI agent is human. It should not be presented as a “team member” with humans
- Don't use "agentic system" in the UI, except for developer audiences
