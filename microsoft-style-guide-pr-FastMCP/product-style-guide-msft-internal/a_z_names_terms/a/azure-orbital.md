# Azure Orbital

Azure Orbital is an umbrella name for a collection of related services that enables customers to communicate, downlink, and process data from their satellites or spacecrafts on a pay-as-you-go basis, so they don’t need to build their own satellite ground stations.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Orbital

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Orbital

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
