# app bundle

In Microsoft Endpoint Manager, an *app bundle* is a set of related apps or app variants that can be deployed to endpoints as a single package or bundle. Different apps in the bundle might run on different platforms and might also include add-ins that work together with other apps in the bundle.

â€‹Lowercase.

On the first mention, use *app bundle*. In subsequent mentions, it's OK to shorten to *bundle* if the meaning is clear.

You can also use *bundle* as a verb to refer to putting a group of apps into an app bundle.
