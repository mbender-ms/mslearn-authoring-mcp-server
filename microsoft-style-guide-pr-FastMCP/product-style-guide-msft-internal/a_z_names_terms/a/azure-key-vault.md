# Azure Key Vault

Service to manage and protect cryptographic keys and passwords used by cloud apps and services.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Azure Key Vault  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Key Vault  

Lowercase when referring to a generic item: *key vault*  

Don’t use *HSM-key* and *soft-key*, internal terms associated with Key Vault. Instead, use *HSM-protected* key and *software-protected key*.  

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
