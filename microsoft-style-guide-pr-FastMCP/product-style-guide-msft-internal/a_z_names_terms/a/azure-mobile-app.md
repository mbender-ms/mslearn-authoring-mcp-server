# Azure mobile app

The mobile version of the Azure portal.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure mobile app
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Azure mobile app
  - If the context is clear, *mobile app* and *app* are acceptable on subsequent mentions.
  - Don't confuse this with an instance of the [Mobile Apps feature](~\a_z_names_terms\m\mobile-apps-mobile-app.md) of Azure App Service.
  - Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
