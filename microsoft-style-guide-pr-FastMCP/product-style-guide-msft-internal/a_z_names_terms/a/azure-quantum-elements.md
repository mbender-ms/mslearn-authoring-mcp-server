# Azure Quantum Elements

A cloud platform designed for teams to work on scale simulations in the cloud. It enables these teams to swiftly screen, study mechanisms, and ultimately design molecules and materials at scale.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Quantum Elements

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Quantum Elements

- Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service. Exception: In the Azure portal, *Azure* is not necessary on subsequent mentions where the Azure context is clear.
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
