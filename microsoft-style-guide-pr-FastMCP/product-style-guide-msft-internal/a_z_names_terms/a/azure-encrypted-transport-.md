# Azure Encrypted Transport

A service under Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Services for US Government Clouds that enables the safe exchange of encrypted data across diverse mediums, such as cloud, satellite, or 5G.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Encrypted Transport 

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Encrypted Transport 

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Localize on all markets.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
