# automation

An *automation* is a predefined workflow that runs in response to a specific trigger, and is generally used to perform simple, repetitive tasks without the need for human input.  

In the context of Microsoft 365 Copilot, use *action* instead of automation. Microsoft 365 Copilot Actions are a branded form of automations that customers can create in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

**Guidelines**

- Don't confuse the term *automation* with agents, which can proactively choose what steps to take (in contrast with Power Automate automations and Copilot Actions). 

- The lowercase term *automation* is different from the uppercase term *Automation*, which refers to Azure Automation.
