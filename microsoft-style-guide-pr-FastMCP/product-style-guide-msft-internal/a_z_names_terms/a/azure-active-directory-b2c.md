# Azure Active Directory B2C

Built on Azure Active Directory, Azure Active Directory B2C is a highly available, global identity management service for consumer-facing applications that scales to hundreds of millions of identities.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C)  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure AD B2C

It's not acceptable to use the full acronym *AAD* or just *AD* by itself.

Always include *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.
