# add, Add

In documentation, use *add* as a verb to describe installing add-ins and add-ons. Use *remove* to describe removing them. Don't use *add* to refer to installing apps and programs. Use *install* instead.

For information on when to use *+Add* in the UI, see the [Figma file for Create experiences](https://www.figma.com/file/38IGh52TpfQnuEiZ1WGeth/?node-id=1470%3A3396).
