# audience insights

As of October 2020, the functionality that formerly made up the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights app is now *audience insights,* one part of Customer Insights. (The other is engagement insights.)

**References in regular text**  

In regular text like marketing copy, documentation, and training material, try to use wording that focuses on the customer’s intent rather than the name *audience insights.*  

When it’s necessary to explain what audience insights is, it’s OK to use wording like “audience insights in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.”

Don’t use “Dynamics 365 Audience Insights” or “Dynamics 365 audience insights.” Never abbreviate the name.

The audience insights capability in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights helps you build a deeper understanding of your customers. With Audience Insights, you can eliminate data silos and unify customer data.

**In the UI**

The audience insights capability uses the Customer Insights app header.

In UI text, including UI labels, try to use wording that emphasizes the user’s intent rather than the name of the capability—for example, “Get a unified view of your customers” rather than “Get started with audience insights.”  

When you do refer to audience insights by name in the UI, use lowercase *audience insights* unless the name appears at the beginning of a text string.
