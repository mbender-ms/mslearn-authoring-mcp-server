# Are you sure ...

A confirmation asks a customer who is committing to an action that can't be undone if they wish to proceed.

**Guidelines**

- Use an "Are you sure?" message only if the consequence of the action is dire. Otherwise, it's an annoying interruption that could be interpreted as condescending.
- Be specific about the consequences, if known.
- Use [Yes] [No] if it's important for customers to understand the consequences before making a decision. [Yes] [No] makes customers read the message.

**Our style**  
If you do X, Y will happen. Are you sure you want to do X? [Yes] [No]  
If you do X, you'll have to do Y to achieve Z. Do you want to do X anyway? [Do X] [Do Z]  
If you cancel, the information you entered will be lost. Are you sure you want to cancel? [Yes] [No]

**Not our style**  
You can't undo this change. [Continue] [Cancel]
