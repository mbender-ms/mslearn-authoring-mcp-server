# App Service

An Azure service that enables developers to build web and mobile apps and automate business processes with API apps.

Azure-branded feature names in Azure App Service: [Web Apps](~\a_z_names_terms\w\web-apps-web-app.md), [Mobile Apps](~\a_z_names_terms\m\mobile-apps-mobile-app.md), and [API Apps](~\a_z_names_terms\a\api-apps-api-app.md).

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure App Service

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: App Service 

To avoid repeating the word *service*, don't use *App Service service*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Lowercase when referring to an instance (something built using) App Service, or generically: *web apps, mobile apps, API apps*

**Examples**  
We've used the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service to build and deploy several web apps.  
My team built a mobile app at the hackathon today using Mobile Apps.  
5 web apps, 3 mobile apps, and 12 API apps [in UI]
