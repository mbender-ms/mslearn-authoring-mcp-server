# Azure Linux

A new product that provides AKS users the same Linux distribution used by Azure engineering teams and Microsoft businesses such as Xbox, Playfab, and Minecraft.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Linux  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Linux  

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the name as an Azure product.  

Always spell out the name; don't use MAL an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
