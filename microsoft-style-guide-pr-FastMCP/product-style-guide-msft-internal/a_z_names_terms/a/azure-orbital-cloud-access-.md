# Azure Orbital Cloud Access

Azure Orbital Cloud Access is a service that provides access to Azure cloud services using satellite communication, and brings connectivity to customers where cloud communication is constrained, unreliable, or non-existent.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Orbital Cloud Access

  - You can omit Microsoft if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
    - The word Microsoft has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

- Subsequent mentions: Azure Orbital Cloud Access

  - Always use Azure to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

  - Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
