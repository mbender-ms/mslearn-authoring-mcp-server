# assign roles

In admin UI, don’t refer to admin roles in terms of membership. You can *assign a role* to a user, but you can’t make a person *a member of a role.*

**Do use phrases like this**  
users assigned to this role  
global admins  
Assign this role to someone

**Don’t use phrases like this**  
member of this role  
global admin members  
Make someone a member of role
