# AppSource

Microsoft AppSource is our marketplace for business apps and technologies.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft AppSource

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: AppSource

Note the capitalization of AppSource. Don't use *Appsource.*

In UX for other products and services, whenever possible include *Microsoft* in the name to help signal that AppSource is a Microsoft service rather than a program, feature, or third-party destination.
