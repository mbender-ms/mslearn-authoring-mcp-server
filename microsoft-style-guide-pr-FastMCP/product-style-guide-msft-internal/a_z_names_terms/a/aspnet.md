# ASP.NET

ASP.NET is an open-source web framework for building modern web apps and services with .NET.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft ASP.NET
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: ASP.NET
- In references to ASP.NET in the UI, documentation, and other text, always include the period and use all uppercase.
