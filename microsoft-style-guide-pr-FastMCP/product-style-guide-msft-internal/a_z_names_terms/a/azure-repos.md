# Azure Repos

An Azure DevOps service that provides a set of version control tools to manage code.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Repos
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Azure Repos
  - Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service unless there are space constraints, for example, in the UI. Without *Azure,* the name is too generic and creates potential legal problems with similar names outside Microsoft.
  - Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
  - Don’t confuse the branding. Don’t say, for example, *DevOps Repos*. Instead say something like “… Azure Repos, one of the services in Azure DevOps.”
