# Azure Orbital Ground Station

Azure Orbital Ground Station is a service that enables customers to communicate, downlink, and process data from their satellites or spacecrafts, so they don’t need to build their own ground station infrastructure.  

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Orbital Ground Station

  - You can omit Microsoft if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
    - The word Microsoft has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Azure Orbital Ground Station  

- Always use Azure to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.  

- Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
