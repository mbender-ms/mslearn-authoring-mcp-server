# admin (Microsoft 365)

An admin is a user with role-based permissions that allow them to change settings for apps, services, users, subscriptions, and/or devices. 

In most cases, use the short form *admin* rather than the formal *administrator.* 

Help content should match the UI. When UI says *administrator*, don’t shorten. 

When UI says *admin*, use that. Use the word *owner* to mean users who have permissions that aren't role-based permissions—for example, a group owner.

**admin roles**

When necessary for clarity, use modifiers to specify what sort of admin role you mean. 

When you’re referring to an admin role by name, use title-style capitalization and spell out *administrator.*

**Examples**  
For Configuration Manager, use Full Administrator. For Azure AD, use Global Administrator.  
Chris is assigned the Global Administrator role.

When you’re referring to a person who has a particular role, it’s OK to shorten *administrator* to *admin* and lowercase the role.

**Example**  
Chris is a global admin.
