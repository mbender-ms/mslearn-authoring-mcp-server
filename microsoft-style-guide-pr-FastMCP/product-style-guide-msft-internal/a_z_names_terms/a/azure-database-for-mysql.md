  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Azure Database for MySQL
- Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.
- Don't include trademark symbols in references to MySQL.
