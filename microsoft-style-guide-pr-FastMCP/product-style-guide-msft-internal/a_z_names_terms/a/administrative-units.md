# administrative units

Administrative units let you restrict the users and groups that an admin can manage to only those in a specific department, a specific region, or any segment that your organization defines.

Use only in content for an admin audience.

Avoid the acronym *AU.* Don't shorten to *admin units;* it can cause localization problems. After the first reference, when the context is clear, you can shorten to just *units.*

**Example**  
Administrative units allow you to grant admin permissions that are restricted to a department, a region, or another segment of your organization that you define. You can use these units to delegate permissions to regional administrators.
