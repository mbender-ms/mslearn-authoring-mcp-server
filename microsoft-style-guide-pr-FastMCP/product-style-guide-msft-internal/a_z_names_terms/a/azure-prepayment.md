# Azure prepayment

Azure prepayment, formerly Azure Monetary Credit, is a way for customers to prepay for eligible Azure products and services.  

**Guidelines**  

- Don't capitalize *prepayment*.  
- In marketing messaging, talk about prepayment in natural language without using the words *Azure prepayment*. For example: Enjoy flexible payment options, including the ability to prepay for eligible Azure products and services.  
- Never append *credit* to this phrase, per CELA guidance. Don't use Azure *prepayment credit*.
