# Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps is the name of the collection of technologies for agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications.

**Guidelines**

- **DevOps:** Don't use to refer to _Azure DevOps_. _DevOps_ is a generic term and shouldn't be used in place of _Azure DevOps_.
- **Azure DevOps**: The general reference to the entire collection of technologies. This is the preferred general reference.
- **Azure DevOps Services**: The cloud offering consisting of the services in the following list. Use this name only when you're referring specifically to the cloud offering. Previously called _Visual Studio Team Services_, _VSTS_, _Visual Studio Online_.
- **Azure DevOps Server**: The on-premises offering of the services in the following list. 
- **Services**: Use the specific service name rather than the general _Azure DevOps_ or _Azure DevOps Services_ when you're referring to the specific functionality that each service provides. For example, “You can sign up for Azure Pipelines here ….”
  - [Azure Artifacts](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-artifacts.md): Manage and distribute packages
  - [Azure Boards](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-boards.md): Manage work with visualizations for work items such as Kanban boards
  - [Azure Pipelines](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-pipelines.md): Build and release CI/CD pipelines
  - [Azure Repos](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-repos.md): Create code repositories for Git and TFVC
  - [Azure Test Plans](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-test-plans.md): Manually testing of apps, including exploratory testing

**Notes**

- No acronyms.
- Precede names with _Azure_ unless there are space constraints, for example, in the UI. Without _Azure,_ the names are too generic and create potential legal problems with similar names outside Microsoft.
- Don't confuse the branding. Don’t say, for example, _Azure DevOps Pipelines_. Instead say something like “… Azure Pipelines, one of the services in Azure DevOps.”
