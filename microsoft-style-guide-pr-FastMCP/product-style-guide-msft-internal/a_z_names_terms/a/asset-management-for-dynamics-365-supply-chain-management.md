# Asset Management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

The Asset Management add-in helps you manage assets and maintenance jobs in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Asset Management Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Asset Management for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Asset Management

Don't refer to Asset Management as an app. Don't use the former name, Asset Management for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

Capitalize *Asset Management* only in references to the add-in. In general references, use *asset management,* lowercase. Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
