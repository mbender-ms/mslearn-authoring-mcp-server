# AI-generated, AI generated

**Guidelines**

Use a hyphen if *AI generated* precedes the noun it modifies, as in "AI-generated content"  

If *AI generated* follows the noun it modifies, don't use a hyphen, as in "This content is AI generated"  

The UI label *AI generated*, lowercase g and don't hyphenate.

**See also** generate; "Compound modifiers" in [Hyphens](~\punctuation\hyphens.md "Hyphens")
