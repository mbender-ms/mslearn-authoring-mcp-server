# APIs

APIs create rules for how two applications communicate and interact with each other. APIs disclose parts of a service application’s code, allowing a second application to accomplish tasks using the service.

**Guidelines**

- The acronym is all uppercase. The plural is *APIs.*
- Don’t spell out *application programming interface.*
- API names are title cased.

In Power Apps content, use phrases such as *manage APIs,* or talk about API management—the ability to expose and connect across APIs within the App Service Environment for Power Apps. Don’t use *API hub* or *API Hub*—there's no such Power Apps feature or destination.

**Note:** The Microsoft Azure API Management service is unrelated to APIs for Power Apps.

In Power Apps and Microsoft Power Automate content, don’t use *registered APIs* or *Registered APIs.* Instead, use *custom APIs* in content about registering APIs.

**Example**  
Channel Integration API for Dynamics 365 [subsequent mentions: Channel Integration API]
