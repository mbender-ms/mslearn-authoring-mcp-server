# Authenticator

The Microsoft Authenticator app provides an extra layer of protection when users sign in, often referred to as two-step verification or multifactor authentication.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Authenticator
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator replaced the Azure Authenticator app. Don’t use *Azure Authenticator* unless referring specifically to the legacy app.
