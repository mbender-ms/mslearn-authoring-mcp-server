# Anyone link

A type of sharing link that allows recipients to access the file or folder without authenticating.

Note the capitalization.

The term is used in SharePoint and Microsoft Teams only. *Anyone link* replaces the terms *shareable link, anonymous access link,* and *guest access link*.

Don't use in content for end users, and avoid using it in content for admins. Instead, describe the link, rather than calling it by the name *Anyone link*.
