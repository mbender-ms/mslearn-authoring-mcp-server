# Azure Data Science Virtual Machine for PyTorch

Along with PyTorch on Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Azure Data Science Virtual Machine for PyTorch allows customers to set up, develop, accelerate, and support PyTorch  models.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Data Science Virtual Machine for PyTorch

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Azure Data Science Virtual Machine for PyTorch, Data Science Virtual Machine for PyTorch

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service (as space allows).

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
