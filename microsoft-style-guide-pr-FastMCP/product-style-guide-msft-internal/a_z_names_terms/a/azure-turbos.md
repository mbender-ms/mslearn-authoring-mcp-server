# Azure Turbos

Azure Turbos is an application platform that makes it possible for customers to quickly build, deploy, and manage any app, anywhere, including web apps, function apps, logic apps, and more.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Turbos

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Turbos

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the name as an Azure offering. Always use *Turbos,* plural, not *Turbo,* singular.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
