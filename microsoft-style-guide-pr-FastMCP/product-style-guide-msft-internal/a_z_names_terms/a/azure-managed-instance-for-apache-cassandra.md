# Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra

This service eases the customer’s transition to cloud services by offering light database management, moderate elasticity, and instance-based pricing for Cassandra (NoSQL) data hosted on Azure infrastructure.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra, or “the managed instance” if it’s clear you’re talking about the Azure service

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
