# add-in

An add-in is optional installed software that adds features to an existing product. An add-in can’t work on its own.

**Guidelines**

Add-in names use title capitalization. To learn more about title capitalization, see [Capitalization standards](~\capitalization-standards\capitalization-standards.md).

Add-in names are structured in this pattern:

[*Foo*] Add-in for + Microsoft + [*Name of App Where the Add-in Is Installed*]

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

If the add-in works with more than one app in a product family, include just the product family name after the word "for"—don’t list all the specific app names that the add-in works with.

Don't use as a synonym for *plug-in or extension*.
