# action (in AI)

In Microsoft 365 Copilot, an action is a multi-step automated task performed by Copilot or another agent in the background, either when scheduled or when triggered by a user or event. It gathers information from one or more sources, then carries out multiple steps immediately or asynchronously—ranging from sending reminder notifications to colleagues to creating documents.

In Security Copilot, an action is a single API call through a plugin when ​a trigger fires; actions can read or write. ​Generally, actions tend to be quick and focused on one immediate act to produce a result.

In Power Platform, including Copilot Studio, an action is a single step in a Power Automate flow. Agents can also perform single actions at will.

**Guidelines**

- Lowercase *action* as an individual instance of the Copilot Actions feature.

- In Security Copilot, use *action* to describe the narrowest step that an agent can take. Don't use it as a synonym for a *multistep action plan* or *activity*.
