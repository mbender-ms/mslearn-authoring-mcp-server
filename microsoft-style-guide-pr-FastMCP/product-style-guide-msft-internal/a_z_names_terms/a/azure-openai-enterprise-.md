# Azure OpenAI Enterprise 

Microsoft Azure OpenAI Enterprise is not to be confused with OpenAI, the AI research and deployment company and maker of ChatGPT.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure OpenAI Enterprise

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- The name is in the studio experience UI.

Subsequent mentions: Azure OpenAI Enterprise

*OpenAI* is one word.

*Enterprise* should be capitalized when it appears as part of the name.  

Do not use *the* before the name, as in *the Azure OpenAI Enterprise*.  

Always spell out the name; with the exception of AI, don't use an acronym or abbreviation.
