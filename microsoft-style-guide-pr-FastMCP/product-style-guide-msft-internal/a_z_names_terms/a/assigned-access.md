# assigned access

The ability to restrict access for a particular user account to a specified app or experience. This feature turns on a predefined set of filters that blocks other actions, so the specified user account can't access the Start menu or other apps or system files.

Don't use *kiosk mode* to refer to this feature, but it's OK to use *kiosk* to describe a possible scenario for this feature. For example, "assigned access lets you use your PC like a kiosk."

**Examples**  
Your business can use assigned access when you want your customers to experience only a single specified app on the PC.  
With assigned access, you can have students use only education apps.
