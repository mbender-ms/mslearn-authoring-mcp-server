# activity group (cybersecurity)

A named attacker group identified through a distinct set of activities, techniques, and infrastructure.  

For security specialist audiences.  

Use as a general term to refer to a named cybercriminal or nation-state actor. Replace with *cybercriminal* or *nation-state actor* only if you have explicit permissions to refer to the group as such.

**Example**  
In this blog, we look at the Winnti malware implant as used by two known activity groups BARIUM and LEAD. We look at how these activity groups introduce the implant to various targets and techniques used by Microsoft researchers to track the implant.
