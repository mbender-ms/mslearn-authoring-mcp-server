# agentic

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that autonomously perceive, decide, and act toward specific goals with minimal human intervention. These systems are characterized by their ability to adapt, plan, and employ reasoning in complex environments.

**Guidelines**

- Sentence case. Don't capitalize *agentic* unless it comes at the beginning of a sentence.
 
- Use as an adjective. The term *agentic* should modify a noun, as in "agentic AI" or "agentic capabilities."
  
- Use sparingly in marketing content unless you're writing for a developer audience. Even within developer-focused content, the term may not be well understood. Ensure the term is clearly defined and contextually relevant before using it.
  
- Don't overuse the term *agentic*. Overusing technical jargon can alienate your audience. Consider alternative phrases like *autonomous agents*, *agent-based*, or *AI powered by agents*. In many cases, it may be better to focus on the benefits of using AI agents or a specific agent instead of referring to agentic AI more generally.
