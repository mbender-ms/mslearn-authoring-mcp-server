# Azure Certified Device program

The Azure Certified Device program is an IoT device certification program that helps device builders promote devices built on Azure.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Certified Device program

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Certified Device program

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Lowercase *program.*

Include *the* as appropriate for the context—that is, *the Azure Certified Device program.*

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
