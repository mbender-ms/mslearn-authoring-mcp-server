# Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Microsoft Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service based on the open-source PostgreSQL database engine.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
      
- Subsequent mentions: Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  
- Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

**Referring to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server**

When referring to the deployment or an instance, as in *Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server*:

- Include *flexible server* (lowercase) in the name.
- Don't include a hyphen.
- It's OK to use just the term *flexible server* when the Azure Database for PostgreSQL context is clear.

  **Examples**

    - Configure zone-redundant high availability for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.
    - Select the flexible server that you want to back up.
