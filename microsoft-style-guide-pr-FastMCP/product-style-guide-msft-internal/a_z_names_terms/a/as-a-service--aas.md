# as a service (-aaS)

Use only *as a service* (-*aaS*) terms listed in this guide's [Aâ€“Z names + terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) or in the [Cloud-computing term list](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/cloud-computing-terms) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide.* These are well-known industry terms that customers are familiar with and understand.

Don't create new acronyms using the *as a service* (-*aaS*) formula. The customer has to spend time and energy on understanding the acronym when we want them to focus on the larger message. Instead, talk about the benefit that the service provides to the customer.
