# Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances. But if space is limited, you can use Azure Reserved VM Instances. If you’ve already used Azure Reserved VM Instances and space is very limited, you can use Azure RI. 

Lowercase when referring to a generic item: reserved instance

**Example**

We used Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances to purchase reserved instances.
