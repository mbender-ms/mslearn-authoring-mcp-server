# autoscale, scale automatically

OK to use to describe the functionality that enables cloud resources (such as servers) to scale in or out automatically based on traffic or demand. (Note this is an exception to Microsoft style, which is not to create new words beginning with *auto-*.)

One word, no hyphen. Lowercase, and don't precede with *Microsoft.* 

*Autoscale* as a verb might need to be used as a UI label, but avoid it in narrative text—it sounds robotic. Instead, use *scale automatically* or similar wording.

**Our style**  
The autoscale feature in Azure Monitor helps you make sure you have the right amount of resources running to handle the load on your application.  
You specify a minimum and maximum number of instances to run and add or remove VMs automatically based on a set of rules. You automatically scale between these two extremes, using rules you create.  
When rule conditions are met, one or more autoscale actions are triggered.  
Automatically scale your Power BI capacity.
