# Azure Edge Zone

Azure Edge Zone is a family of offerings that enable data processing close to the user, in population centers that are far away from Azure regions.

There are several Azure Edge Zone offerings.

## Guidelines for Azure Edge Zone

First mention: Microsoft Azure Edge Zone

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Edge Zone

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Don’t include *the* in references to Azure Edge Zone. Don’t use *Azure Edge Zones,* plural, when referring to multiple offerings or locations. If you need to refer to Azure Edge Zone locations generically, use *edge zone.* 

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Examples**  
Azure Edge Zone provides small-footprint extensions of Azure placed in population centers that are far away from Azure regions.
