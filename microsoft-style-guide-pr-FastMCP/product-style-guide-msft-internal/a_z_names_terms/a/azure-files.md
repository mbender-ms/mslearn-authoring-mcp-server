# Azure Files

An Azure service that offers file shares in the cloud. It is part of Azure Storage.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Files

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Files

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Don't use earlier names *File storage* or *File service*.

Don’t use *Azure File* or *File storage service*.
