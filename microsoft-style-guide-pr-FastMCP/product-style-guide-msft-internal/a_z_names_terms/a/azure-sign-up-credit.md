# Azure sign-up credit

Azure sign-up credit, formerly Azure free credit, is the $200 credit customers receive when they sign up for an Azure free account.  

**Guidelines**  

- Use only in the customer experience (for example, the Azure portal) for customers with this type of credit.  
- Don't capitalize *sign-up credit*.  
- Don’t use *Azure free credit* in marketing or external materials such as Azure.com pages, documentation, or readiness materials. Instead, focus on how the $200 credit works in natural language. For example: When you sign up for an Azure free account, you get a $200 credit to use on Azure services in the first 30 days.
