# Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace enables startups and software development companies to offer their apps and solutions to Azure customers.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Marketplace

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Marketplace

Don't include *the*. It's *Azure Marketplace*, not *the Azure Marketplace*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
