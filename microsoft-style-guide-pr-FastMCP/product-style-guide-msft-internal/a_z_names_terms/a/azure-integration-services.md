# Azure Integration Services

Microsoft Azure Integration Services is a collection of Azure services that help customers connect and integrate both cloud and on-premises services and within an organization.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Integration Services  

  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mentions: Integration Services  

- To avoid repeating the word service, don't use *Integration Services service*.  

- Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
