# Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is a command-line tool for managing Azure resources.

**Guidelines for the current version**

First mention: Microsoft Azure CLI

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure CLI. If context is clear, CLI by itself is acceptable.

**Guidelines for the old version**

First mention: Microsoft Azure classic CLI

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: classic CLI

Use to refer only to the first version, which pertains to the Azure classic deployment model.

**Guidelines for both versions**

There is no need to spell out CLI as *command-line interface*. It's a well-known industry acronym.

Include *the* in references to the CLI.
