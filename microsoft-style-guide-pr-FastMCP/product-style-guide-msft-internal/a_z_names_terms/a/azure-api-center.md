# Azure API Center

A service that enables organizations to centrally organize and manage their portfolio of APIs, irrespective of the API type, life cycle stage, or deployment location.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure API Center

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  
- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface. 
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name. 

In reference to Azure API Center, don’t spell out *API* as *application programming interface*.

Subsequent mentions: Azure API Center

Localized in all markets. 

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.  

Always spell out *Azure API Center*; with the exception of *API*, don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
