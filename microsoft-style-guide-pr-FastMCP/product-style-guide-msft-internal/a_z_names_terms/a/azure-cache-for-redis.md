# Azure Cache for Redis

Azure Cache for Redis is a distributed, in-memory, managed cache that helps build highly scalable and responsive applications, by providing fast access to data.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Cache for Redis

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Cache for Redis

Always include *Azure* in the name to distinguish the Microsoft service from the open-source Redis cache. 

When referring to a generic instance, use *cache* or *Redis cache*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
