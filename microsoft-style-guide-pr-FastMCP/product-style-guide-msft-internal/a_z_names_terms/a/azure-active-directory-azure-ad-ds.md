# Azure Active Directory (Azure AD DS)

Active Directory Domain Services provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD DS)

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure AD DS

It's not acceptable to use the full acronym *AAD* or just *AD* by itself.

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.
