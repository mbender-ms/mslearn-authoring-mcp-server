# Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is the platform service that provides a single source for monitoring Azure resources.  

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Monitor
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Azure Monitor
- It's OK to shorten the name to *Monitor* in UI or on subsequent mentions when space is limited and the Azure context is apparent.
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
