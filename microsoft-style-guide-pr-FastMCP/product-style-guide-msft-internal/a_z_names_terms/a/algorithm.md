# algorithm

In technical content for a maker/analyst audience, it's OK to use *algorithm* to refer to the sequence of step-by-step instructions given to a computer that equips it to use AI to solve a specific, usually complex, problem.

Avoid *algorithm* in content for end users. Instead, use *instructions, model,* or similar wording. Or talk about what the algorithm is used for, such as ranking or predicting.

Don't use *algorithm* in a general or figurative sense not having to do with AI or computer science, such as "your algorithm for business success."
