# account

*Account* can refer to:

- a personal Microsoft account
- a work or school account (in the Azure Active Directory system)
- a storage account
- the customer record for Microsoft transactions

Customers can sign up for a new Microsoft Azure subscription using either their *Microsoft account* or *work or school account:*

- **Microsoft accounts** (created by you for personal use): Enables access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Microsoft 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. A Microsoft account can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/account/default.aspx)

- **Work or school accounts** (issued by an admin for business/academic use): Enables access to cloud services such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft 365. When a customer signs up as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent their organization. After this directory has been created, an admin can then create users and assign licenses to them based on which cloud service subscriptions they need access to, such as Azure.

**Guidelines**

For sign up/sign in, always specify which account type you mean: *work or school account* or *Microsoft account.*

Donâ€™t use *account* when you mean a *storage account* unless the context is obvious or has been established.

Use *free account* instead of *free trial* on azure.com to encourage signups for Azure. Example: "If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a free account."
