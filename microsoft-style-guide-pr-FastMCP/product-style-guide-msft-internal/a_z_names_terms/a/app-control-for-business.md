# App Control for Business

The feature for Windows commercial customers that helps mitigate security threats by restricting the applications that users are allowed to run and the code that runs in the System Core (kernel).

**Guidelines**

â€‹First mention: App Control for Business  

Subsequent mentions: App Control  

In UI where it will not be confused with any other App Control or Smart App Control, it is OK to shorten to just "App Control."  

It's also OK to append the phrase "in Windows" to either the short or long form of the name, if the product context is needed, as in "App Control for Business in Windows."  

Don't use "Application Control."  

This name aligns with "Smart App Control" which is a similar feature for consumers.
