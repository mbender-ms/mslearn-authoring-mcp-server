# Azure DNS

Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that uses Azure infrastructure to provide name resolution.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure DNS

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure DNS

Always include *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service. In references to the Azure DNS service, don't spell out *DNS* as *Domain Name System*.
