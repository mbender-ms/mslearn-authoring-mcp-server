# AI, artificial intelligence

Use *AI*. Don't spell out *artificial intelligence*. 

It's OK to use *AI* in descriptive terms like generative AI, AI-powered, AI assistance, AI assistant, or AI tool (as well as to use intelligent feature or intelligent technology).

AI is a category of technology that can give computers the human-like abilities of hearing, seeing, reasoning, and learning. AI isn’t one technology, but rather an umbrella term that covers technologies that can be used on their own or in combination:

- Computer vision
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Machine learning
