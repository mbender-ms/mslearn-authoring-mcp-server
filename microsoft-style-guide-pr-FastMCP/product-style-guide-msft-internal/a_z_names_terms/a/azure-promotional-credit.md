# Azure promotional credit

Azure promotional credit, formerly Azure Monetary Credit, refers to funds granted by Microsoft to customers for future purchases of eligible Azure products and services provided through the Azure Credit Offer program. This term is not publicly marketed.  

**Guidelines**  

- Use in the customer experience (for example, the Azure portal) for customers with this type of credit.  
- OK to use internally for seller-facing materials within the context of the Azure Credit Offer program.  
- Don't capitalize *promotional credit*.  
- Don’t use in marketing or external materials such as Azure.com pages, documentation, or readiness materials.
