# account picture

The picture that's associated with a user account in Windows or a Microsoft account. This picture is shown on screens or menus that display the person's username, such as the Start menu.

- Use *account picture* if you need to clarify which picture you're referring to.
- If there's no ambiguity, shorten to *picture* (preferred).
- Don't use *user tile* (internal jargon).
