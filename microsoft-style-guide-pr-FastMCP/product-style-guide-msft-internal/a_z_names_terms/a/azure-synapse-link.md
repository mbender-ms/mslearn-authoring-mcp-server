# Azure Synapse Link

Microsoft Azure Synapse Link is a feature that enables customers to easily and directly link data from various data sources to Azure Synapse Analytics.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Synapse Link

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Synapse Link

For legal reasons, always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

This feature name is an exception to our capitalization style for features, which is to lowercase them.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
