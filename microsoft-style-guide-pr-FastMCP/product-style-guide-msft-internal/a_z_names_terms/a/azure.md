# Azure

*Microsoft Azure* is the name of Microsoft's platform of commercial cloud services for IT pros and developers. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com)

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure services or Microsoft Azure

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure

The product descriptor is *cloud platform* or simply *platform*. Don't use *Azure cloud* or *Azure Cloud.* Don't use *the Microsoft Cloud* to refer to Azure*.

For information about whether to use *in Azure* or *on Azure* in reference to Azure features and functionality, see [in Azure vs. on Azure](~\a_z_names_terms\i\in-azure-vs-on-azure.md) in the A–Z names + terms list.
