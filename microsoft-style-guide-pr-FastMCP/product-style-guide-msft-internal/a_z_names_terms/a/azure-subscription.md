# Azure subscription

An Azure subscription is a container of Azure resources/services that can be created and managed within the Azure plan. You can create one or more Azure subscriptions under an Azure plan at pay-as-you-go pricing. In the customer-led and field-led motions, customers sign up for an Azure account, for which they can create multiple subscriptions within. In the partner-led motion, customers get assigned an Azure plan by the CSP, for which the CSP can create one or more subscriptions within.
