# Applied AI Services

Azure Applied AI Services isn’t a single Azure service, but rather a category of Azure AI products.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Applied AI Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Applied AI Services

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
