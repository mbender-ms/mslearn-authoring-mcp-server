# Azure IoT

Microsoft Azure IoT is a collection of Microsoft-managed cloud services that connect, monitor, and control billions of IoT assets. In simpler terms, an IoT solution is made up of one or more IoT devices and one or more back-end services running in the cloud that communicate with one another.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure IoT

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure IoT

Azure IoT is an intentional exception that allows an acronym in the name. Don't spell out *Internet of Things* in references to the Azure IoT name; always use *IoT*.
