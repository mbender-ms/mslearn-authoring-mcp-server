# app, application

A product that provides standalone functionality and is available to customers by subscription or license. After itâ€™s generally available, it has an SLA and can have metering (if it isn't free) and status reporting.

In general, both _app_ and _application_ are acceptable. _App_ is preferred in names and when space is limited.

**Examples**  
Migrate existing on-premises applications to the cloud.  
Deploy your web app 

In Microsoft Power Apps content, use _app_ and _apps_ to refer to what you make with Power Apps. In Microsoft Power BI content, _app_ refers to a bundle of dashboards, reports, and datasets. It also refers to the mobile apps for consuming content, such as _Power BI app for iOS_. To minimize use of the word _app,_ focus on the customer and their needs or what they're trying to achieve.
