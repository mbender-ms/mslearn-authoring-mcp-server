# Azure Migrate and Modernize

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Migrate and Modernize

- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Migrate and Modernize

- Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
