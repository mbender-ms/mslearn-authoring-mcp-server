# app module

Don't use _app module_ to refer to customized versions of Dynamics 365 apps for customer engagement, which provide a limited set of functionality that’s relevant for a specific group of users.

Instead, use just _app_ or _customized app._ See [customized app](~\a_z_names_terms\c\customized-app.md) for guidelines.

**Exception**  
It’s OK to use _AppModule_ in references to the entity type where information about the purpose-built app is stored. Note the capitalization and spelling. 

**See also** [module](~\a_z_names_terms\m\module.md), [customized app](~\a_z_names_terms\c\customized-app.md)
