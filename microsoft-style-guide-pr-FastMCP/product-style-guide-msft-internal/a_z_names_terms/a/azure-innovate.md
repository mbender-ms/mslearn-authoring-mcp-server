# Azure Innovate

Microsoft Azure Innovate is a newly expanded program provides end-to-end support for Azure Migration and Modernize engagements.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Innovate  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Azure Innovate  
Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.  
Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
