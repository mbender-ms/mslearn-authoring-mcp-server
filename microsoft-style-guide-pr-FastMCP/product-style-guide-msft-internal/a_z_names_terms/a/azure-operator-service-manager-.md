# Azure Operator Service Manager

A product under Azure for Operators that enables management of multi-part/multi-vendor apps across hybrid cloud sites (Azure regions, edge platforms, or Arc-connected sites).  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft Azure Operator Service Manager  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Azure Operator Service Manager  

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.  

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
