# Azure Business Continuity Center

A service that allows customers to monitor and manage their continuity goals throughout their organization.  

**Guidelines**  

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Business Continuity Center  

  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

- Subsequent mention: Azure Business Continuity Center  

  - Title-cased and the name is to be localized in all instances.  

  - Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

  - Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
