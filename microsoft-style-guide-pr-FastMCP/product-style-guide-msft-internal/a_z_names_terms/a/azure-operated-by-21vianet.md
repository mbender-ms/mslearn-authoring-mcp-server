# Azure operated by 21Vianet

A public cloud using Microsoft Azure technologies and officially operated by 21Vianet in China. It delivers a separate instance of Azure from datacenters in China.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure in China

Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

No longer refer to it as *Azure China*.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
