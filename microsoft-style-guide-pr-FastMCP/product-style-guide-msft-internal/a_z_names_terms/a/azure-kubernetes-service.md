# Azure Kubernetes Service

An Azure service that simplifies the deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes (container cluster manager).

Note: This is the new name for Azure Container Service. Use Azure Container Service only when specifically referring to the older service.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or AKS. We typically don't use acronyms for product names, but AKS is a legally approved exception for compete reasons.

Don't abbreviate *Kubernetes* to *K8s* or similar.

To avoid repeating the word *service*, don't use *Azure Kubernetes Service service*.
