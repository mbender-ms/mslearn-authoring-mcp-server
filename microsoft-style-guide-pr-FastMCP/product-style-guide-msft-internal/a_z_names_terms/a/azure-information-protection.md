# Azure Information Protection

A service that uses classification, labeling, and protection to help secure files and email. Azure Rights Management provides the protection by using encryption, identity, and authorization policies. This data protection solution works across multiple devices—phone, tablets, and PCs—to protect information inside and outside an organization.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Information Protection
- Subsequent mention: Azure Information Protection
- Always include *Azure* to avoid confusion with Windows Information Protection.
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
