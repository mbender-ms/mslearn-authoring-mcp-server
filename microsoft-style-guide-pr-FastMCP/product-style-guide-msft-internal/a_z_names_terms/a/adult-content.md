# adult content

Content that's explicitly sexual, violent, or otherwise objectionable.  

The preferred term is *adult content* rather than *mature content.* Avoid *explicit* except when it's necessary to clarify the type of adult content being discussed.

**Examples**  
You'll be asked whether you want to block adult content.  
Some adult content might be explicitly sexual, violent, or otherwise objectionable.
