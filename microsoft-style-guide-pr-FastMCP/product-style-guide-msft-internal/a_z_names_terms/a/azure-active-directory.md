# Azure Active Directory

As of July 11, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is now being called [Microsoft Entra ID](~\a_z_names_terms\m\microsoft-entra\microsoft-entra-id.md).

The identity service in Microsoft Azure that provides identity management and access control capabilities through a REST-based API. (The on-premises product is Windows Server Active Directory.)

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Subsequent mentions: Azure AD
- Whenever using the name for the first time in marketing materials or documentation, use *Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra*.
- It's not acceptable to use the full acronym *AAD* or just *AD*.
- Always use *Azure* to distinguish the service name as an Azure service.

**See** [Acronyms and abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md), [Windows Server Active Directory](~\a_z_names_terms\w\windows-server-active-directory.md); [Microsoft Entra ID](~\a_z_names_terms\m\microsoft-entra\microsoft-entra-id.md) in the *Microsoft 365, Security, and Windows Style Guide*.
