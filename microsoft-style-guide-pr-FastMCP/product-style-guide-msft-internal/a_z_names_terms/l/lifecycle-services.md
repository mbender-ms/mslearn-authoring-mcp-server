# Lifecycle Services

Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services is a Microsoft Azure–based collaboration portal that provides a unifying, collaborative environment along with a set of regularly updated services that help you manage the application life cycle of Dynamics 365 implementations.

**Guidelines**

First mention:

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Lifecycle Services

Note that *lifecycle* is one word, which is an exception to the two-word guideline found in the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

Always spell out; don't use *LCS* or other abbreviations of the name.

Always use numerals for *365.*
