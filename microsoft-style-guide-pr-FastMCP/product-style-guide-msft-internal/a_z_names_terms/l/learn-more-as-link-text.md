# Learn more (as link text)

In product UI, use this as standard link text when the link leads to documentation outside of the product UI. The linked content typically provides more information about a preceding statement in the UI. 

Always include a description of the destination content within the link text after the phrases *Learn more...*, *Learn about..*., or *Learn how....* 

Avoid *Learn more* as a label by itself, without also including what you can learn about. 

Common, acceptable variations of this phrase include:

- **Learn more about** {concept or task} - Use if the linked content expands on info that was in the preceding description.
- **Learn about** {concept or task} - Use if the linked content introduces a concept that was not directly discussed in preceding description.
- **Learn how to** {do this task} - Use if the linked content explains how to do something.

Links from product UI to documentation typically open in a new tab, and should include an ARIA describedby label: "Article opens in new browser tab.
