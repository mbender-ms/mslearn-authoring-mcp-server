# live connection, live mode

SQL Server Analysis Services multidimensional models in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service are *live connections* to data sources.

Use *live mode* to refer to publishing and uploading reports that use SQL Server Analysis Services multidimensional models in the Power BI service.

Lowercase both terms.

Donâ€™t use *Live Connect* and *Connect Live.* These terms are retired.
