# Logic Apps, logic app

Logic Apps is a service that automates the access and use of data across clouds without writing code.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Logic Apps

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Logic Apps

Lowercase *logic app* and *logic apps* when referring to an instance/output of using the service.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Examples**  
We used Logic Apps to build and deploy several logic apps.  
My team built a logic app at the Hackathon.
