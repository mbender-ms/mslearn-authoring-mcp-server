# Load Testing

Load Testing is an Azure service that enables developers and testers to generate insights on how to improve the performance, scalability, and capacity usage of their applications.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Load Testing

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Load Testing

Lowercase *load testing* when referring to output of the service or in generic references to the process of measuring a system’s response to demand.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
