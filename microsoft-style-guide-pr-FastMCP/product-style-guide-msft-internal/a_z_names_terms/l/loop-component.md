# Loop component

Microsoft Loop components are live, connected experiences that allow individuals to complete work in the context of chat, emails, meetings, documents, etc.

**Guidance**

First mention: Microsoft Loop component  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Loop component  
Never pluralize *Loop*.  
Don't capitalize *component*.  
It’s OK to shorten Microsoft Loop to just *Loop* (for example, a Loop component) after the first reference within the same experience.  
When describing individual components created with Microsoft Loop, always use *Loop* as a modifier of component, so the plural would be Loop components.  

**Example**: Your meeting notes and action items can now be Loop components.
