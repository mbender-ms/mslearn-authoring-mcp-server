# library

A collection of items, such as files and folders, assembled from various locations. The locations might be on your PC, an external hard drive, removable media, or someone else's PC.  

Avoid *library*Â as a concept. In general, just cut the word, and use phrases like "in Documents, Music, and Pictures" instead. Or, if an additional descriptive word is needed, use *folder.*
