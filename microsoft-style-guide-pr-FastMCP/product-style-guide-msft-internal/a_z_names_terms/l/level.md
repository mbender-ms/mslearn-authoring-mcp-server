# level

Microsoft Rewards has two tiers called levels (1 and 2), used to describe the customer’s current position/achievement in the Microsoft Rewards program.  

**Guidelines**  

Sentence-cased when used generally.  

**Example**  

Don’t lose your level.  

Title-case when referring to specific levels.  

**Example**  

Get 500 points this month to keep your Level 2 status.  

You can use *tier* or *status* to describe a level but use it sparingly.
