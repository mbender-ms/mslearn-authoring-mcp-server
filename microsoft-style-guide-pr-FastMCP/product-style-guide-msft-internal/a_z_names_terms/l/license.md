# license

For Windows Media Player, don't use *license* to refer to the entity that determines what customers can do with protected files. Instead, use *media usage rights, usage rights, play rights, sync rights,* and *burn rights.*  

*Media usage rights* and *usage rights* are used to refer collectively to multiple rights, such as play, burn, and sync rights.
