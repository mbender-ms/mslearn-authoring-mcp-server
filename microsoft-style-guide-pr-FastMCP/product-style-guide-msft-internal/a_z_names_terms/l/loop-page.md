# Loop page

Microsoft Loop page brings components, links, tasks, apps, and teams together to help users think, connect, track, and get tasks done as a team.  

**Guidance**  

First mention: Microsoft Loop page  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Loop page  

Never pluralize *Loop*.  

Don't capitalize *page*.  

Only use *page* in the context of Microsoft Loop.  

It’s OK to shorten Microsoft Loop to just *Loop* (for example, a Loop page) after the first reference within the same experience.  

When describing individual pages created with Microsoft Loop, always use *Loop* as a modifier of *page*, so the plural would be Loop pages.
