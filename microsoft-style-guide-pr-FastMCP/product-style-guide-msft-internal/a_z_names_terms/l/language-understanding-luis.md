# Language Understanding (LUIS)

**Note:** *The family of Azure Cognitive Services is being realigned, and the following guidelines may change in the future.* *The style guide topics related to Cognitive Services will be updated as soon as the naming and portfolio changes are finalized.*

Language Understanding (LUIS) is a service within Azure Cognitive Services that applies natural language processing to conversational text to predict meaning and extract relevant information.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Language Understanding (LUIS)
- Subsequent mentions: LUIS
- Donâ€™t use *Azure LUIS* or *Microsoft LUIS.* LUIS is part of Azure Cognitive Services but it isn't Microsoft or Azure branded.
- The *LUIS* acronym is an acceptable exception to the general guideline to avoid acronyms.
