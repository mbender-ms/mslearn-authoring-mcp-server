# link

OK to use as a noun or verb. If you're directing the user to select a link, use just *link*. Don't use *hyperlink*.

**Examples**

You can link multiple contacts so all their info shows up in one contact card.  
You can also share any link from a webpage by pressing and holding the link that you want to share.
