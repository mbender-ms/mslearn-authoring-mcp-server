# label

Don't spell labeled or labeling with two *L*s, as in *labelled* and *labelling*.

**In an AI context:**

Labeling is the process of annotating raw data with meaningful to labels to aid with model fine-tuning.

- When the audience is makers and analysts, it's OK to use the AI meaning of *label*—and related terms like *labeling* and *labeled* data—as needed without defining the term.
- When the audience is end-users, don't use AI technical terms like *label*. Instead, focus on the user's intent and the steps they need to take to accomplish their task.

**In a security context:**

*Label* is a general term for the object that can be applied to items for the purposes of classification, protection, or retention. For example, Microsoft Purview includes two types of labels: sensitivity labels and retention labels.

- Use a modifier before label when possible to provide context. For example, *sensitivity label* or *retention label*.
- Don't use *classify* to refer to the action of applying a label to an item. Just say *label* the item.
