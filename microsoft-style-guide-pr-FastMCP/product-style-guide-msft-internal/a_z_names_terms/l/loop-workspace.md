# Loop workspace

Microsoft Loop workspaces let individuals see, group, organize, and stay up to date with all of their Loop pages and files in a single space.

**Guidance**

First mention: Microsoft Loop workspace  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the topic name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mentions: Loop workspace  
Never pluralize *Loop*.  
Don't capitalize *workspace*.  
It’s OK to shorten Microsoft Loop to just *Loop* (for example, a Loop workspace) after the first reference within the same experience.  
When describing individual workspaces created with Microsoft Loop, always use *Loop* as a modifier of workspace, so the plural form would be Loop workspaces.  

**Example**: Add a Microsoft Loop workspace to your Teams chat to collaborate on action items, agendas, and more.
