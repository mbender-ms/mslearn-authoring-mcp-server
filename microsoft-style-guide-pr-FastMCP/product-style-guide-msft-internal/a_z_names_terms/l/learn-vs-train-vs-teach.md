# learn vs. train vs. teach

Although using these terms in reference to computers is anthropomorphic, they are all OK to use as appropriate. This is particularly true in content for AI apps because an AI-enabled system does learn, and humans do train it and teach it.

Just be sure that the use of these verbs is technologically correct. That is, they're appropriate in the context of machine learning, but avoid them in general discussions of computer functionality.

Note that there's a slight difference in meaning between *teach* and *train: teach* is more general, whereas *train* suggests focused or concentrated skills acquisition. *Teach* is also now becoming associated with the Microsoft concept of machine teaching.

**Examples**

We recommend that you train the model after the data is refreshed in your organization for better prediction accuracy scoring.
