# nudge

Nudge is not a preferred term for a notification. Unless it's been approved for your product, use a more descriptive term such as *notification* or *reminder*.

Some products use the term nudge as a name for a specific type of reminder notification. 

**Guidelines**

If you need to use the term nudge:

- Use sentence case. 
- Use as a noun.
- Don't use as a verb.

**Not our style**

Nudge your teammates.
