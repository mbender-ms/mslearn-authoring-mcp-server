# natural language processing

**Always spell out. Don't use *NLP*.**

Use *natural language processing* (not *natural language understanding*) as appropriate in technical content for a maker/analyst audience.

Avoid referring to the technology by name in content for end users. Instead, use friendlier, less technical wording that describes the process or what the user will gain from it.
