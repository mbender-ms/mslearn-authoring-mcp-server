# notification

A notification informs customers of events unrelated to their current activity. A notification can result from a customer action or significant system event, or can offer potentially useful information or a recommendation.  

Use *notification* instead of *alert* to refer to a system message. Also, customers get a *notification,* not a *notice*.
