# nation-state actor

In cybersecurity, a *nation-state actor* is an organization that's directed by a state government and that's responsible for directly launching attacks or working with other groups to launch attacks.

Microsoft rarely attributes attacks to specific nation-states, so use this term with caution. If you don't have explicit approval to indicate that an attack was performed by a nation-state actor, consider the broader term *activity group* to refer to an organization that has been named and linked to certain activities by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC).

Note that *nation-state* is hyphenated.
