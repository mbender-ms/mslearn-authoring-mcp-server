# Notification Hubs

The Azure service that provides a highly scalable, cross-platform push notification infrastructure. It can send notifications from either an on-premises or Azure-based back end to applications running on mobile devices with extremely low latency.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Notification Hubs
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent: Notification Hubs
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
- Lowercase when referring to an instance/output of using the service: notification hub
- Use a singular verb. Example: "Notification Hubs is..."

**Example**

- This topic shows you how to use Azure Notification Hubs to send push notifications to a Windows Store app. You begin by configuring your notification hub and then connecting it to the app.
