# Storage, storage

*Service name:* Service and umbrella name for a collection of related services: Blob Storage, Azure Files, Queue Storage, and Table Storage.

*Noun:* Space available for storing something.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Storage
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Storage
- Avoid *Azure Storage service*.
- Use lowercase noun *storage* instead of *space* or *memory*. 
- Acceptable: storage account, standard storage account, premium storage account
