# sync, synchronize

Sync, not synchronize, a file, folder, or library to a local drive, a SharePoint drive, a server, or the cloud. You can also sync settings, messages, and other data across devices, apps, and accounts.  

**Guidelines**

Don't include the h from synchronize. Use sync, syncs, synced, and syncing, not synch, synchs, synched, or synching.
 
In general, use the phrase *sync with*, instead of *sync from* or *sync to*. If information is being synced both to and from two sources, describe it as syncing between them or syncing across.  

Localization considerations: The truncation of sync, syncs, synced, and syncing don't save space when localized. In all other languages, localization uses the unabbreviated forms.

**Examples**

- sync across (devices, locations, apps, etc.)
- will sync (as in “these settings will sync”)
