# storage

Use as a descriptor for *space* if you need to specifically refer to the kind of space that the customer has on their device. Don't use *memory.*

Don't use *storage* to refer to available space on a disk. Use *disk space* instead.

It's OK to use *storage device* to refer generally to external drives, USB drives, and other types of storage hardware.
