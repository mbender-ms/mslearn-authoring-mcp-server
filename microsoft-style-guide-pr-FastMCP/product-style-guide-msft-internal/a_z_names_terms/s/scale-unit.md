# scale unit

A base configuration of web and worker role instances and related services. A scale unit supports a defined degree of load in an application that can be easily duplicated and deployed to support additional load. A scale unit might consist of, for example, three web roles, two worker roles, one queue, and two SQL databases.

**Guidelines**

Lowercase.
