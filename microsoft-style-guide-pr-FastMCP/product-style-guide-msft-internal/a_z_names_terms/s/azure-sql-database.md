# Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is a relational database management service with enterprise-class availability, scalability, and security.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure SQL Database
  
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
      
- Subsequent mentions: SQL Database
  
- Use lowercase database when referring to a SQL database created using Azure SQL Database or any other product, unless you need to make a distinction between databases in a sentence or paragraph.

**Examples** 

Create a database in the Azure SQL Database service as part of your application.  
Create a NoSQL or SQL database as part of your application.
