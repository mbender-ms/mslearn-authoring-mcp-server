# sensitivity label

A label that defines how confidential certain content is and then applies the associated security measure, helping users to remain compliant with their organization's information-protection policies.  

Lowercase.  

In general, refer to sensitivity labels being applied to documents, emails, and similar objects in order to classify and protect them.

**Example**  
When you apply a sensitivity label, the label information will persist with your document or email, even when it's shared between devices, applications, and cloud services.
