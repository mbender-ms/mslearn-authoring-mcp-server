# Service Bus

The Azure service that provides developer-oriented messaging capabilities and a secure messaging infrastructure for widespread communication, large-scale event distribution, naming, and service publishing.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure Service Bus
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Service Bus
- Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
