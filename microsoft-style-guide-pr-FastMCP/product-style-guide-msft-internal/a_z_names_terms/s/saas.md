# SaaS

Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the internetâ€”as a web-based service. Write around it whenever possible by using alternatives like web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.

**Guidelines**

- software as a service (SaaS) on first reference
- OK to use just SaaS on subsequent mentions

In the context of Power BI, software as a service (SaaS) providers, such as Salesforce and GitHub, supply content packs that are preformatted to include useful and relevant data. Lowercase *provider* in *SaaS provider*.
