# snapshot

In Power BI, a snapshot is a static image vs. a live image of a tile, dashboard, or report. Lowercase *snapshot.* Don't use *static.*

**Examples**

- Share a snapshot of a tile using the Power BI for Mobile app. You can annotate the image before you send it. 
- Publish a snapshot of a report on your blog. 
- Create a story that includes snapshots of reports.
