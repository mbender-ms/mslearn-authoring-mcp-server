# select

- Use the word *select* when telling someone to click or tap an option. This word choice is input-neutral and helps us meet accessibility guidelines.
- Use *select* (or its counterpart *clear*) when writing instructions about checkboxes.
- Don't use *click* or *tap* for this because they aren't input-neutral. It's OK to occasionally use *choose* or another word (for example, *pick*) to keep from repeating *select*.
- In procedures, use bold formatting for the name of the thing that the user needs to select. When there are several things in a row to be selected, use the right angle bracket (>) to separate them.
- Don't use *unselect the checkbox.* Instead, use *clear the checkbox*.
