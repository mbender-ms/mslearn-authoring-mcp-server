# System Guard

System Guard is a security feature that provides startup and runtime protections that the operating system can validate and report on.

**Guidelines**

The unbranded name _System Guard_ is replacing all instances of _Microsoft Defender System Guard_ and _Windows Defender System Guard._  
Always capitalize.  
Do not brand or shorten.

**Our style**  

- System Guard reorganizes the existing Windows system integrity features under one roof.
- If System Guard indicates that the device lacks integrity, the management system can take a series of actions.

**Not our style**  

- Microsoft System Guard reorganizes the existing Windows system integrity features under one roof.
- Learn about the requirements for Microsoft Defender System Guard.
