# Store Commerce

Store Commerce is an app for brick-and-mortar retail stores that use Dynamics 365 Commerce. With Store Commerce, users such as cashiers, sales reps, stock clerks, and managers can process sales transactions, place and fulfill customer orders, view inventory availability, and perform in-store inventory tasks.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Store Commerce app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Any of the following are acceptable if they’re clear in context:

- Store Commerce app in Commerce
- Store Commerce app
- Store Commerce

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
