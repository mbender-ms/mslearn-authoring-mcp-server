# SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher

Create SQL Server mobile reports connected to on-premises data sources. You can view these mobile reports on SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services report servers (native mode, not SharePoint mode) and also on iPhones and iPads. Additional mobile device support is planned.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher
- You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
  - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
  - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent: Mobile Report Publisher

Previously known as Datazen.
