# Show more, Show less

Label for an expandable section that, when clicked, exposes more details about a particular item.  

**Guidelines**  

Use *Show more* and *Show less* as standard string for expandable/collapsible sections in UI text. Alternatively, name the thing that will be shown in that section, e.g., "Contact info."  

**See also** [hide, show](~\a_z_names_terms\h\hide-show.md), [Show vs. See](~\a_z_names_terms\s\show-vs-see.md)
