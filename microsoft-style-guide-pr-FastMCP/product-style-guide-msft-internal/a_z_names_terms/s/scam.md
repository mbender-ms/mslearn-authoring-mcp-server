# scam

A slang term for a fraudulent business scheme, a swindle.

As with all slang, avoid.

It's tempting to use this word in email and security copy because it pairs nicely with *spam* in English. But don't use the word *scam;* it's fraught with liability. To accuse someone of running a scam is to accuse them of criminal activity.
