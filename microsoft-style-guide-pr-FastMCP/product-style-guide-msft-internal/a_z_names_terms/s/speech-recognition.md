# speech recognition

In content for makers and analysts, it's OK to use *speech recognition* as needed without defining the term.

In content for end users, avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

In Microsoft content, the terms *speech recognition* and *voice recognition* are used in different contexts. In general, *voice recognition* is used broadly, to indicate whether a system is voice enabled. *Speech recognition* connotes that the voice recognition is used for specific tasks, such as to execute a command or convert speech to text. In most content for Microsoft AI products, *speech recognition* is the appropriate term.
