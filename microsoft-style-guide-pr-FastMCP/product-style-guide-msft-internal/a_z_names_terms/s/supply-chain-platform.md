# Supply Chain Platform

A marketing handle that represents the Microsoft collection of supply chain offerings.  

**Guidelines**  

First mention: Microsoft supply chain platform  

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.  
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.  

Subsequent mention: supply chain platform  

Lowercase if proceeded by *Microsoft*.  

Always spell out the name; don’t use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
