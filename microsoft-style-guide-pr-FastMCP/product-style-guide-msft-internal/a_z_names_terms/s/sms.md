# SMS

Acronym for *Short Message Service.* *SMS* is another term for a text message.

Avoid using *SMS* in content for the US audience. Use *text message* instead. For other markets where *SMS* is more commonly used, localization will use the appropriate term.

When you do use *SMS,* note the capitalization—don't use *sms* or *Sms.*
