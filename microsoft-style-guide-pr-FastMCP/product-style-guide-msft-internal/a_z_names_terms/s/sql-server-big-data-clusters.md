# SQL Server Big Data Clusters

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft SQL Server Big Data Clusters

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Big Data Clusters

Lowercase when you're not referring to the product itself but to a grouping of high-value relational data with high-volume big data that provides the computational power of a cluster.

Always spell out; don't use *BDC* or other abbreviations. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
