# SQL Server R Services

SQL Server R Services brings scalable, R-based analytics directly into a SQL Server 2016 database.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft SQL Server R Services

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: SQL Server R Services

To avoid repeating the word *service(s)*, don't use *SQL Server R Services service*.
