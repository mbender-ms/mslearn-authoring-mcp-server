# SDK

**Guidelines**

- Use all uppercase. The plural is *SDKs*.
- Donâ€™t spell out *software development kit*.
- SDK names use title-style capitalization.
- *SDK* is acceptable as a subsequent mention if the context is clear.
- Use *an SDK*, not *a SDK*.

**Examples**  
Microsoft Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python [subsequent mentions: Machine Learning SDK for Python]  
Speech Devices SDK for Azure Cognitive Services [subsequent mentions: Speech Devices SDK]  
Speech SDK for Azure Cognitive Services [subsequent mentions: Speech SDK]
