# Spot Virtual Machines

Formerly just a purchasing option, Azure Spot Virtual Machines is now an Azure service that makes it possible for customers to buy unused Azure compute capacity (virtual machines) at deep discounts, compared to pay-as-you-go prices.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Spot Virtual Machines

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Spot Virtual Machines

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

Lowercase when referring to an instance created using the service: *spot virtual machine.*
