# Storm

HDInsight includes the ability to create clusters based on the open-source Apache Storm (currently in preview) to process real-time events on a large scale. Such large-scale processing supports use cases like Internet of Things.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Storm

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Storm
