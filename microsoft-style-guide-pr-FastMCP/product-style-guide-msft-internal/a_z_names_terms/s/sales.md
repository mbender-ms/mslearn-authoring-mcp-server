# Sales

Dynamics 365 Sales helps customers zero in on the right leads, contacts, and opportunities as they build out their sales pipeline.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Sales

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Sales.”

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*

**Our style**  

With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, salespeople build strong relationships with their customers and close sales faster. Use Dynamics 365 Sales to keep track of your accounts and contacts, create sales collateral, and create marketing lists and campaigns. With the Sales app, you can even nurture your sales from lead to order.

**References to the Sales mobile app**

The Sales mobile app is scheduled to go into public preview in November 2020. When you need to refer specifically to the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, follow these guidelines.

On the first mention, refer to *the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app,* and include wording that signals the mobile app is currently in preview.

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can refer to just *Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Sales,* or *Sales* if it's clear from the context that you mean the mobile app.

Subsequent mentions: the Sales mobile app, the mobile app

**Examples**

Access the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app (in preview) quickly when you're on the go, using only your email address.
