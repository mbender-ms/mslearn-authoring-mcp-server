# single-use code

A code that can be used in place of a password to sign in. Customers request a single-use code and receive it on their mobile phone or at their alternate email address. Each code can be used only once.

Lowercase. Note the hyphen in *single-use.* 

**Example**  
If you're signing in on a public computer, you can use a single-use code instead of your password for added security.
