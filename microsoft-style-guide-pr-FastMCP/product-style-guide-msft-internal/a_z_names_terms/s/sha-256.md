# SHA-256

Refers to a cryptographic algorithm used to create a hash value with 64 hexadecimal characters, or to the hash value itself. 

To refer to the hash value generically or to multiple types of hashes, use *hash* or *file hash* for files. 

Note the capitalization and hyphen. 

Don't hyphenate *SHA-256* in PowerShell commands because it won't work. Use only in content for the security admin audience.
