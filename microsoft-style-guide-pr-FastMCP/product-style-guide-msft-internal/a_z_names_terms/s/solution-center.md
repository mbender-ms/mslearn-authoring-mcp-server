# Solution Center

Microsoft Cloud Solution Center is a portal-based experience that guides customers and partners through the deployment of comprehensive Microsoft solutions such as Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Cloud Solution Center

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Cloud Solution Center, Solution Center

Note that *Solution* is singular. Don’t use *Solutions Center.*

Don’t include *the.* It’s Microsoft Cloud Solution Center, not *the* Microsoft Cloud Solution Center.

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
