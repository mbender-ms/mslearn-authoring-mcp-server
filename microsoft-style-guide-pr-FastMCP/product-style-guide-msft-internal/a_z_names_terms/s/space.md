# space

Use to refer to available storage capacity on a hard drive. Use the phrase *free up space* to refer to deleting files to make room on the customer's device.

It's OK to use *storage* to describe space if you need to specifically refer to the kind of space that the customer has on their device.

Use *memory* only to refer to application memory.â€¯
