# SQL Server Reporting Services

Always spell out *SQL Server Reporting Services* in general content and the UI.  

Itâ€™s OK to use *SSRS* in documentation and technical help after the full name has been spelled out and the acronym introduced.

**Guidelines**

In general content and the UI:  
- First mention: SQL Server [version number] Reporting Services  
- Subsequent mentions: SQL Server Reporting Services  

In documentation and technical help:  
- First mention: SQL Server [version number] Reporting Services (SSRS)  
- Subsequent mentions: SSRS  

To avoid repeating the word *service(s)*, don't use *SQL Server Reporting Services service*.
