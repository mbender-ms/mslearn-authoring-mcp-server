# security update

A broadly released fix for a product-specific, security-related vulnerability.

Use in Microsoft products to refer to updates for security purposes. Don't use *patch*, except as related to third-party software products that use that term.

**See** [update](~\a_z_names_terms\u\update-microsoft-365.md), [quality update](~\a_z_names_terms\q\quality-update.md), [feature update](~\a_z_names_terms\f\feature-update.md)
