# savings plan

Use to refer to the Azure pricing model where customers commit to a fixed hourly expenditure on compute services for one or three years, in exchange for lower prices.

Lowercase. Note that it’s *savings,* plural, not *saving plan.* It’s OK to use *savings plans* in the plural, and use *the* or *a* as appropriate for the context.

Individual plans for specific Azure product categories are referred to like this:

[*foo*] savings plan

**Examples**  
There’s a new way to save on Azure—you can now purchase a savings plan.  
With savings plans, you can save on pay-as-you-go pricing.  
When you purchase a compute savings plan, you can save up to *x* percent on pay-as-you-go prices for Azure compute services.
