# SQL Database Advisor

Feature of SQL Database that evaluates the history of your SQL database and makes recommendations to help you create and drop indexes, parameterize queries, and fix schema issues.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft SQL Database Advisor
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: SQL Database Advisor
- Previously known as SQL Azure Index Advisor.
