# search box

The text box in which someone types keywords to begin a search in Windows or another product.

**Guidelines**

- Don't capitalize unless you need to match the UI.
- Don't call it *search bar, search field,* orâ€¯*search text box.*
- Refer to the results of a search as *search results* not *hits.*
