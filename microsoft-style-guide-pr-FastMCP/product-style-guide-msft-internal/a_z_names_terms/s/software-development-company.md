# software development company

The term *software development company* is replacing the terms [independent software vendor (ISV)](~/a_z_names_terms/i/independent-software-vendor-isv.md) and [Digital Native](~/a_z_names_terms/d/digital-native.md).

Software development companies are technology-led companies that build, operate, and sell their own software or apps with a high degree of technical maturity and adoption of modern engineering practices.

**Guidelines**

First mention:  software development company, software development companies

Subsequent mentions:  software company, software companies
  
- Sentence case.
- Don't use the acronym *SDC* unless space is limited due to character count restrictions.
- When you must use the acronym, always spell out the term on first mention, followed by the acronym in parenthesis. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**Replacing the terms ISV and Digital Native in your content**

In most cases, you can avoid references to ISV and Digital Native altogether, focusing on what Microsoft can help them achieve:

- Before: “As an ISV, you can develop software faster with the help of AI tools.”
- After: “Develop software faster with the help of AI tools.”
  
In cases where you just need to replace either term, you can simply swap it for software development company/companies:

- Before: “See how Digital Businesses are excelling.”
- After: “See how software development companies are excelling.”

When you're talking about individual people performing a role, rather than the entire company, try to use a more descriptive term:

- Before: “Writing code quickly and safely is paramount to ISVs with tight deadlines.”
- After: “Writing code quickly and safely is paramount to software developers with tight deadlines.”
