# spyware

Software that displays ads, collects information, or changes computer settings without obtaining informed consent.

If you need to define the term in customer-facing content, use this CELA-approved definition:

Software that can display advertisements (such as pop-up ads), collect information about you, or change settings on your computer, generally without appropriately obtaining your consent.
