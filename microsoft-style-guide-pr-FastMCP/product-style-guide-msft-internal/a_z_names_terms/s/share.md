# share

Use as a verb to refer to sharing files, photos, links, webpages, and so on, with other people in a message or on social networks.

Don't use as a noun—for example, don't use *network share.*

Use *shared folder* to refer specifically to a shared folder. Use *shared resource* to describe any object (such as a folder, printer, or program) that’s shared, or if the type of shared item is unknown.

Use *start sharing* and *stop sharing* to describe changing the access permissions for an item; don’t use *share* and *unshare* for this.

**Examples**
