# speaker recognition

In content for makers and analysts, it's OK to use *speaker recognition* in references to the functionality of the Azure Cognitive Services API.

In content for end users, avoid talking about the technology and instead talk about the benefits to the user or what the user wants to do with it.

Even with a maker/analyst audience, make sure the meaning is clear and define the term if necessary. For information about speaker recognition, see [What is speaker recognition?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speaker-recognition/home).
