# Search, search

Microsoft Search is the machine-learning search capability that provides users query results from across their organization’s data and across Microsoft apps and services.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Search  
Subsequent mentions: Search

**See also** [Basic attribution guidelines](~\product-and-feature-names\basic-attribution-guidelines.md)

**Example**  
Whichever app users are working in, Microsoft Search is personal. Because users see only results that they already have access to, Search might show each user different results.

Use lowercase to refer to the search feature in Windows and other products.

**Examples**  
Use search to find what you're looking for.…  
Open search from the taskbar.  
Type **control panel** in the search box.
