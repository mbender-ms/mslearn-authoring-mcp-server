# SQL Data Warehouse

In November 2019, SQL Data Warehouse was replaced by [Azure Synapse Analytics](~\a_z_names_terms\a\azure-synapse-analytics.md).

If you need to refer to SQL Data Warehouse in transition or legacy content, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: SQL Data Warehouse

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
