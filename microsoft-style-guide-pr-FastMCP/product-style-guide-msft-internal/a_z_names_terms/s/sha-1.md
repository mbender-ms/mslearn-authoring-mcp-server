# SHA-1

Refers to a cryptographic algorithm thatâ€™s used to create a hash value with 40 hexadecimal characters, or to the hash value itself.

To refer to the hash value generically or to multiple types of hashes, use *hash* or *file hash* for files.

Note the capitalization and hyphen.

Don't hyphenate *SHA-1* in PowerShell commands because it won't work.

Use only in content for the security admin audience.

**Example**  
Weaknesses in SHA-1 could allow an attacker to spoof content, execute phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks when browsing the web.
