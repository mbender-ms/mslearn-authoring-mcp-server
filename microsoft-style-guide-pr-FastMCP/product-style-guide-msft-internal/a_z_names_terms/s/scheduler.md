# Scheduler

With Azure Scheduler, customers can create jobs in the cloud that invoke services inside and outside Azure. They can create jobs that run right away, on a regular or irregular schedule, or at a future date.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Scheduler

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Scheduler

When the name appears by itself (as a noun), don’t precede it with “the.” But if the name functions as an adjective, the name can be preceded by “the.”

**Our style**
