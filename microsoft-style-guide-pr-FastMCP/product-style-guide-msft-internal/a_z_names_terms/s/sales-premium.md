# Sales Premium

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Premium

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone: Sales Premium

Don’t include *for* in the product name, as in “Dynamics 365 for Sales Premium.”

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
