# SQL Server

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft SQL Server

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: SQL Server

When necessary, it's OK to reference the platform—for example, *SQL Server on Linux*.

**SQL Server 2022**

SQL Server 2022 is the next planned release of SQL Server. When you’re talking about functionality that’s specific to that release, refer to *SQL Server 2022* (or *SQL Server 2019,* and so on).

If you’re referring to the SQL Server family in general, or if the context makes it clear which specific release you’re talking about, it’s OK to use just *SQL Server.*

**Examples**  
Whether your data is structured or unstructured, query and analyze it using SQL Server.  
SQL Server 2022 is the most cloud-connected release yet, enabling easier cloud integration and new cloud-based disaster recovery.
