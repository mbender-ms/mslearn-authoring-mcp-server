# Spot Blocks

Azure Spot Blocks is a compute service in the Azure Virtual Machines portfolio. Spot Blocks provides a new type of spot virtual machine, for which the customer can specify the Spot Virtual Machines runtime.

Spot Blocks lets a spot virtual machine run uninterrupted for a specific period of time (that is, a “block”).

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Spot Blocks

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Spot Blocks

Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).
