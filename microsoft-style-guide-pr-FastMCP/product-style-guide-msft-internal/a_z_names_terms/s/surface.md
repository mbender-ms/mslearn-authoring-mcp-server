# surface

Don't use *surface* as a verbâ€”it can sound like technical or business jargon. Instead, use a friendlier, more familiar verb like *appear, show up,* or *find.*

**Our style**  
Use an entity list and entity forms to find all leads on the portal.  
On an entity list, a filter will be added to whatever model-driven app views are found by that list.  
If tasks appear on an entity list, a filter is essentially added to the list so that only tasks that are related to a lead will show up in the list.
