# StorSimple

StorSimple is a hybrid online cloud storage service for enterprises designed to reduce costs and improve data protection.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure StorSimple
- Subsequent mentions: StorSimple
- Don't use *Azure StorSimple.* (This branding inconsistency is due to legal details surrounding StorSimple as an acquisition.)
- When you use *StorSimple appliance* to refer to an instance of the StorSimple service, note that *appliance* is lowercase. Don't use *StorSimple Appliance.*
- The StorSimple Manager service is an extension that lets you manage a StorSimple device or StorSimple virtual device from a single web interface. Note the capitalization of *StorSimple Manager.*
