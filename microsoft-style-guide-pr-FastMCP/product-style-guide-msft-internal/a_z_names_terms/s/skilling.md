# skilling

Skilling is the practice of gaining knowledge and abilities through guided and self-serve trainings.  

**Example usage**: 

- Browse the collection of *skilling* resources in Microsoft Learn. 
- Start *skilling* on Azure Skills Navigator with these helpful guides.  

In general, use a plain-English term thatâ€™s more friendly to a global audience like *learning* or *training* instead of *skilling*. Use *skilling* only where it's unavoidable, such as when referring to a program or asset name that includes it.  

Similarly, choose a plain-English alternative to the related terms *reskilling* and *upskilling*, when possible.
