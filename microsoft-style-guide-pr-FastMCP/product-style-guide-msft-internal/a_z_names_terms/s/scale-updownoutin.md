- **Scale down** – To reduce hardware capacity to accommodate a decrease in demand. For example, reduce CPU, disk, or storage resources. Scaling down is a type of vertical scaling.
- **Scale out** – To add service node capacity to accommodate an increase in demand. For example, add web servers or cluster nodes. Scaling out is a type of horizontal scaling.
