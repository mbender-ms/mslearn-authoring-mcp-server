# Skype for Business Online

Skype for Business Online was a cloud communications service that provided intuitive communications capabilities across presence, instant messaging, audio/video calling, and an online meeting experience that includes audio, video, and web conferencing. It reached "end of life" on July 31, 2021. Organizations can no longer purchase or renew their existing subscription to it, and remaining tenants were migrated to Microsoft Teams in the summer of 2021.

**Guidelines**

All mentions: Skype for Business Online

Note: Although Skype was acquired by Microsoft, the technology behind Skype for Business was developed by Microsoft. In third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isn’t present, we attribute it to Microsoft by saying “Skype for Business, by Microsoft.”
