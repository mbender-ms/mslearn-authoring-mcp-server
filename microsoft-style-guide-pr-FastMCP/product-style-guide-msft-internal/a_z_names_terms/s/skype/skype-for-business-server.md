# Skype for Business Server

Skype for Business Server is real-time communications server software that provides the on-premises infrastructure for enterprise instant messaging, presence, VoIP, and ad hoc and structured conferences (audio, video, and web conferencing).

**Guidelines**

All mentions: Skype for Business Server  

Note: Although Skype was acquired by Microsoft, the technology behind Skype for Business was developed by Microsoft. In third-party communications and in Microsoft communications where the Microsoft logo isn’t present, we attribute it to Microsoft by saying “Skype for Business, by Microsoft.”

Capitalize *Skype* and *Business Server*, but lowercase *for*.
