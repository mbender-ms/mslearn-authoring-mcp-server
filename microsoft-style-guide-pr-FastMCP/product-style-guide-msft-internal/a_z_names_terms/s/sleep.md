# sleep

A power-saving state in Windows that saves the customer's work and puts the computer into a state of low power consumption.

- The computer (not the hard drive or the operating system) sleeps.
- Use all lowercase when referring to *sleep, hibernation,* and other Windows power states, except when documenting UI labels.
- Avoid using *sleep, hibernation,* and *shut down* as modifiers of *state* or *mode* (for example, *sleep mode* or *the hibernation state*).
- Use *sleep* instead of *sleeping.*
- Avoid saying *put [the computer] to sleep.*

**Examples**  
By default, your computer goes to sleep after a period of inactivity.  
If your computer is asleep and you move the mouse, the computer will wake.  
Select **Start** [glyph] > **Power** [glyph] > **Sleep** [glyph] to put your computer into a power-saving state without shutting down.
