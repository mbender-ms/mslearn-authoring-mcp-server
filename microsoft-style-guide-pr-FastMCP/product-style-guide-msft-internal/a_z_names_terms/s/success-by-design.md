# Success by Design

Success by Design for Dynamics 365 is the prescriptive guidance (approaches and best practices) for designing, building, and deploying a Dynamics 365 solution.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Success by Design for Microsoft Dynamics 365
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: Success by Design
- Capitalize *Success by Design* only in references to the Success by Design guidance and processes.
- Avoid using *success by design* in casual references, as in, “Learn how you can achieve success by design in your own project.”
- Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
