# Start button, Start menu

- For clarity, use the glyph along with Start [as in, "Select **Start** (<img src="~/media/1086348946.png">)"].  
- Always capitalize *Start.* 
- Don't use bold formatting for *Start* unless the word occurs in a procedure. Follow the guidelines in [Formatting text in instructions](/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide. 
- Don't use *Start page, home screen,* or *quick launch* to refer to the Start menu or Start button. 
- Don't use *Windows Start* (<img src="~/media/1869112808.png">) *button*—just use *Start* (<img src="~/media/1775171997.png">) *button.*
- Don't include the word *button* unless it's needed for clarity. If you do, *button* is lowercase. 
- It's OK to use just *Start* to refer to the Start menu when the menu has already been mentioned and the context is clear. 

**Examples**  
Select **Start** (<img src="~/media/1812031940.png">) > **Settings** > **Devices** > **Mouse & Touchpad**.   
Pin apps to the Start menu.
