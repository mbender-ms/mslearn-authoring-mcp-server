# Supply Chain Insights

Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights is an app in the Dynamics 365 supply chain portfolio that helps businesses to employ AI to predict and overcome disruptions in their supply chain.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, the app name can be used alone:

Supply Chain Insights

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
