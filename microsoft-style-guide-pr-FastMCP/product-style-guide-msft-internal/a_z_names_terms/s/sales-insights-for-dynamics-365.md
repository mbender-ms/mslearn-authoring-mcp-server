# Sales Insights for Dynamics 365

The Sales Insights add-in helps you continuously analyze the vast collection of customer-interaction data already stored in your Dynamics 365 Sales and Microsoft 365 databases. Sales Insights is available as an add-in for Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise and Microsoft Relationship Sales.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Sales Insights Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Sales Insights for Dynamics 365 Sales, Sales Insights

If the association has already been made with Dynamics 365, you can omit *Dynamics 365.*

Don’t refer to Sales Insights as an app.

Don't use *AI for Sales.*

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
