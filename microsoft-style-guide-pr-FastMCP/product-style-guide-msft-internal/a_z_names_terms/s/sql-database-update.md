# SQL Database Update

This release brings near-complete SQL Server engine compatibility, in addition to performance that helps streamline SQL Server application migrations to Azure.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft Azure SQL Database Update
  - You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:
    - The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
    - The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.
- Subsequent mentions: SQL Database Update
