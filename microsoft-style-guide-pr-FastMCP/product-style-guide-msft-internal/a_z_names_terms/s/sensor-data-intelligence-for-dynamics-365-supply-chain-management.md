# Sensor Data Intelligence for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

Sensor Data Intelligence is an IoT-enriched add-in for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management business application that consumes data from Azure IoT Hub.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Sensor Data Intelligence Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:  

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

You can omit *Add-in* if necessary to save space and the context is clear—for example, when the name appears in a list of add-ins.

Subsequent mentions: Sensor Data Intelligence for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Sensor Data Intelligence

Don't refer to Sensor Data Intelligence as an app.

Never abbreviate the name, and always use numerals for *365.*
