# Security Center

In November 2021, Azure Security Center and Azure Defender were combined and rebranded as Microsoft Defender for Cloud.  
If you need to refer to Security Center in transition or legacy content, follow these guidelines.  

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft Azure Security Center  
You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Azure service name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Security Center  
Always spell out the name; don't use an acronym or abbreviation. For details, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~\acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).

**See** [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](~/a_z_names_terms/m/microsoft-defender/microsoft-defender-for-cloud.md).
