# SQL Server Stretch Database

SQL Server Stretch Database dynamically stretches SQL Server databases to Azure.

**Guidelines**

First mention: Microsoft SQL Server Stretch Database

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: SQL Server Stretch Database, Stretch Database
