# Snipping Tool

A feature that lets customers easily capture a screenshot by doing a free-form snip, a rectangular snip, a window snip, or a full-screen snip.

For a time in Windows 10, Snipping Tool was replaced with *Snip & Sketch.*

- Use title-style capitalization.
- Don't precede with *the.*
- The term isn't trademarked.â€¯
