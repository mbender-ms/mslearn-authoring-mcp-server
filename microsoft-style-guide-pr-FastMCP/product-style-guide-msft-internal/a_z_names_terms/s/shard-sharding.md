# shard, sharding

It's OK to use *sharding* to refer to a type of partitioning that divides large databases into smaller databases, which can be managed faster and more easily across servers.  

A *shard* is an individual partition. A database that has been partitioned in this way can be referred to as *sharded.*

To make the context clear, use *database sharding* or *database shard* on the first mention. After that, itâ€™s OK to use just *sharding* or *shard.*
