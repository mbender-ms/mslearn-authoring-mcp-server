# sync

Sync, not synchronize, a file, folder, or library to a local drive, a SharePoint drive, a server, or the cloud.  

**Guidelines**

- Don't include the *h* from *synchronize*. Use *sync*, *syncs*, *synced*, and *syncing*, not *synch*, *synchs*, *synched*, or *synching*. 
- In general, use the phrase *sync with*, instead of *sync from* or *sync to*. If information is being synced both to and from two sources, describe it as syncing between them or syncing across.
- International considerations: *Sync*, *syncs*, *synced*, and *syncing* don't save space when localized. In all other languages, localization uses the unabbreviated forms.
