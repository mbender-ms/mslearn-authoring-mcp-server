# stuff, things

It's OK to use *stuff* or *things* in casual references to mean files or online activities. However, these words convey little info and are easy to overuse, so try to find alternatives first. For example, instead of "put your things in one place," try "put everything in one place."

Avoid when precision is important, such as references to settings and files that will be retained or migrated as part of Windows Easy Transfer or a system reset. If customers need to have a clear understanding, don't use words that are open to interpretation.

**Examples**  
Windows Easy Transfer preserves the things that you care about the most: your personal files and settings.  
All the stuff you use the most is on the Start screen.â€¯
