# SQL database

A SQL database is a type of relational database that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.

**Guidelines**

- It's OK to use the acronym *SQL* without spelling it out on first mention.
- Use lowercase *database* when you're referring to a SQL database or are using the term generally. 
- It's OK to use just the term when database when the SQL context is clear.
- Capitalize *Database* when you're referring to a branded product, as in Azure SQL Database.

**Examples**

Build limitless, trusted, AI-ready apps on a fully managed SQL database.

SQL database in Microsoft Fabric allows you to easily create an operational database.

Azure SQL Database provides different deployment options for your database.
