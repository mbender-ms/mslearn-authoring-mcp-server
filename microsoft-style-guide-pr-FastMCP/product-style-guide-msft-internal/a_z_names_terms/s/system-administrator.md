# system administrator

Don't use unless absolutely necessary. This is often a vague term, and most people don't know who their system administrator is. Use *support person* or *organization* instead.

**Examples**  
You need to have administrative privileges to sign in to the Google Apps administrator control panel, or you'll need to contact your system administrator.  
Some settings are managed by your organization.
