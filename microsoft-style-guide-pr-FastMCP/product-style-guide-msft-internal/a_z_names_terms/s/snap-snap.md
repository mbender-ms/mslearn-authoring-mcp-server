# Snap, snap

Snap is a feature in Windows that automatically resizes and attaches an app to a side of the screen so that people can easily display apps side by side.

As a verb, *snap* means to move an app into a locked position on the screen. It's also occasionally usedâ€¯to describe taking a picture.

- Capitalize when referring to the feature.
- Lowercase when using as a verb.
- Don't use *snappable.*

**Examples**  
If you drag the app to the right, it will snap to the right side of the screen.  
The Snap feature lets you snap apps to the left, right, top, or bottom.
