# SQL Server Analysis Services

Always spell out *SQL Server Analysis Services* in general content and the UI.  

Itâ€™s OK to use *SSAS* in documentation and technical help after the full name has been spelled out and the acronym introduced.  

When you refer to a specific instance of SQL Server Analysis Services, capitalize only the name, not the noun it's modifying, such as *database, data,* or *object.*

**Guidelines**

- First mention: SQL Server [version number] Analysis Services
- Subsequent mentions: SQL Server Analysis Services

In documentation and technical help:

- First mention: SQL Server [version number] Analysis Services (SSAS)
- Subsequent mentions: SSAS
