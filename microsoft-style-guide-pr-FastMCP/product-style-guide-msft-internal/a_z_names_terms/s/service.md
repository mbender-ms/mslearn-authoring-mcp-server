# service

A product that provides standalone functionality and is available to customers by subscription or license. After it’s generally available, it has an SLA and can have metering (if it isn't free) and status reporting.

Avoid adding the word _service_ after product names unless it adds clarity, such as to differentiate between parts of the Power BI product family. Don’t add _service_ to product names that include the word _service._
