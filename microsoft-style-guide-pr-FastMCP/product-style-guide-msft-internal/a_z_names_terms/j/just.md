# just

Use with care. "Just" is often added in an effort to make the approach seem more casual, but it can introduce problems because the adverb form has a half-dozen meanings, many of which are contradictory.

If *only* can be used, it's often clearerâ€”*only* has fewer meanings and that's often what *just* is standing in for. In many cases, either word is superfluous, and the clause can stand firmly without either one.

Don't use *just* as a way to trivialize a complex process.

Be aware that *just* can be read as overly folksy or impatient.
