# Best practices for content design (UX writing)

When working on content design within a user experience, follow these five steps.

## Step 1: Understand the customer

Ask yourself these questions to help get into the mindset of the customer:

- **Who _is_ the customer?** For example, will _everyone_ see this screen, or is it for advanced customers only?
- **What is the customer trying to do?** (Not what do we _want_ them to do.) Is this part of a larger task or customer goal? Is this a warning, error, or notification?
- **What is their frame of mind?** Are they excited to get started? Or frustrated because they've been interrupted? This helps you determine what tone to take, from conciliatory, to neutral, to light and playful.

## Step 2: Look at the flow

Ignore the words and focus on the end-to-end flow for now. Imagine the ideal flow, and discuss alternatives with PM and design. Consider bringing the flow to peer review or a colleague for a fresh perspective.

Here are some questions to keep in mind:

- Where did the customer come from and where do they go next?
- Is the most important info in the most noticeable spot?
- Is it clear what will happen when you select each available option/link?
- What does the customer need to know to make the right decision?
- Is every step in the flow necessary?
- Can some steps be combined for brevity, or separated for clarity?
- Are any screens missing from the flow?
- Is the flow focusing too much on edge cases or trying to incorporate features that few people will use rather than optimizing for the majority of our customers?
- Ask PMs for missing details about the scenarioâ€”do you understand what's happening well enough to explain it?

## Step 3: Choose your words

The words you choose should be easy to understand, have the right amount of info, and lead the customer to the right action for them.

Here are some approaches for the initial draft:

- **Temporarily forget about guidelines.** You'll apply them later, but applying them too early may constrain creativity and clarity.
- **Use the words and tone that your customer might use.**
- **Give enough info but not too much.** Is there enough info for the customer to understand what they're doing and what will happen next? Can you cut info that isn't helpful or required?
- **Read your draft aloud.** Try explaining the scenario as if you're talking to a friend who isn't very technical.
- **Collaborate.** Take your initial draft to a content crit, your lead, or another writer to help you identify potential issues.
- **Then, apply the rules.** When you're satisfied with the draft text, apply the styles and standards that this team and your feature team require.

## Step 4: Edit your text

Before you send your draft to your PM and designer, make sure that it does all of these things:

- **Meets feature team requirements.** This includes character count limits (add 50 percent for loc), formatting and syntax limitations, and technical accuracy.
- **Follows the Microsoft voice principles** along with guidelines for your audience. Be simple and human; warm and relaxed; crisp and clear; and ready to lend a hand. Choose a tone that mirrors the customer's likely emotional state.
- **Focuses on the customer.** The text relates to the customer's goals, choices, and tasks, instead of describing UI interactions or technologies. Make sure the customer feels they're in control and understands their options.
- **Provides the right info at the right time.**
  - Focus on only the most important concepts, and simplify them.
  - Support, but don't duplicate, info from the previous and next screens.
  - Provide any additional context needed to help the customer make informed choices.
- **Is world-ready.** Take localization considerations into account, but not at the expense of voice or tone. Provide comments for loc with notes or alternate wording where needed.

## Step 5: Get final feedback from PM and design

- Once you're satisfied, present your content design solution to the PM and designer you're working with for final feedback.
- Set up a meeting to discuss it in person. Walk through the flow with the new text and see if any info is missing, is misleading, or breaks the design in some way.
- Once your content design solution is handed off, follow up to confirm that it's in the build as you specified.
