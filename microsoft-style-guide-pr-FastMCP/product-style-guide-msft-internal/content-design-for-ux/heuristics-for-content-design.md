# Heuristics for content design

Heuristics are a set of attributes that characterize quality content design in user experiences. These heuristics were developed as a tool or framework to help writers and their design and PM partners evaluate the quality of a piece of content design and discover ways to improve it.  

Good content design is:  

**Scannable**, **Confidence-building**, and **Customer-centric**. 

Under each of these top-level heuristics are 3 additional qualities to look for.

## 1.  Scannable
The most important info is understood at a glance.  

### Understandable

- Lead with what's most important.
- Use plain language—everyday words familiar to a less experienced user.
- Avoid jargon and acronyms. Explain technical terms that we can’t avoid.
- Use simple sentence structure that's clear at a glance.

### Concise

- Be as brief as possible, without compromising clarity.
- Omit non-essential supporting information or link off to it in docs/support.
- Balance conciseness against completeness and understandability.

### Coherent

- Use consistent words and interaction patterns across experiences, so customers quickly recognize what they mean and what to do.
- Follow guidance first in this style guide, followed by the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/welcome).

## 2.  Confidence-building  
Customers feel confident that they know what's happening, what to do, and what the impact will be.  

### Complete

- Provide all the info the user needs to make a decision (and no more).
- Balance completeness against conciseness, linking off to supplementary info that is only needed by a minority of users.

### Actionable

- Customers know what to do, and what results to expect.
- Next steps are clear, follow logically, and propel them to finish their task.
  - If it's an error, how do I fix it?
  - What are the consequences of actions I take?
  - What should I do next?

### Conversational

- Use friendly language that inspires confidence.
- The words flow naturally when spoken out loud, as in a conversation with a friend. No robot language!
- Use contractions like *you're* and *doesn't*. Use articles like *a*, *an*, and *the*, as you would when speaking.
- Follow our [Microsoft Voice Principles](~\voice\voice.md).

## 3.  Customer-centric  
Focus on the customer’s goals, and the value they get, rather than Microsoft’s goals, processes, and silos.

### Empathetic

- Anticipate the customer's needs and feelings. Adjust your content to address their concerns, and your tone to meet their emotional state:
- If faced with a blocking error, don't joke around.
- If they're about to do something hard or risky, provide reassuring details.
- If a difficult process is now complete, celebrate the moment.

### Accessible

- Content aligns to WCAG content accessibility guidelines, [MARVEL content accessibility guidelines (opens in Figma)](https://www.figma.com/file/HEQiS2rKRQWT7Ph81keQcvv9/Accessibility-Guidance?node-id=11316%3A7956), and other [accessibility resources listed in this style guide](~\accessibility.md).
- Test your flow with Narrator.
- Use ARIA text and tooltips to describe visual elements and symbols that can't be read by screen readers.
- Avoid reference to left or right, or specific user input methods like a mouse click.

### Inclusive

- Write with sensitivity to our diverse audience, including considerations for technical expertise, region, race, and gender.
- Include notes for localization if the words you use are colloquial or region-specific.
- Follow the standards outlined by our global readiness team, and [guidance for bias-free communication in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/bias-free-communication).
