# SEO

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of ensuring your content and content architecture have the right elements to help search engines find your content and display it in web searches. The higher a page ranks in the results of a search, the greater the chance that the page will be visited.

For foundational guidance on SEO, see [Search and Writing](/style-guide/search-writing) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

Also, see the SEO Quick Reference for [SEO best practices](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SEOBestPractices/SitePages/seo-quick-reference.aspx). 

Follow these tips for SEO success.

## Anticipate customer intent

*Intent* is the information that the customer is looking for. It’s what your topic is meant to answer when a customer enters a query into a search box.

An intent has a narrow focus. Pick an intent, and then write about that intent:

- **Good intent**  
  *Verify a domain*  
  This article is about one intent, and it unambiguously tells users what to expect. Just be sure you write exclusively about that intent.
- **Not-so-good intent**  
  *Domain issues*  
  What might this article cover? Users develop their own expectations, and all users’ expectations might not be the same. Those who don’t find the specific issue they’re seeking give negative feedback. This leads to dissatisfaction, which someone has to fix at some point. It’s better to write a good title and appropriate content that produces a good user experience in the first place.

As a content developer, answer the following questions before you start to write:

- Does any existing content already answer the intent?  
  If so, don't write another article.
- What question would a user ask that your topic title and content answer?  
  Determine the keywords that attract users to the content, and use them when you write.
- If users wrote this content, would their version sound like yours?  
  If SEO works and a user finds your content, that’s good. If the user can’t then understand the content, that’s bad. Therefore, use the [voice guidelines](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) (in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide) when creating your content.

## Write an informative, easy-to-understand title

- Use a target keyword phrase and branding that answers the customer intent.
- Focus on tasks, not feature names. Customers typically do not search for features by name.
- Include the relevant application and version (such as "Word 2019") to help differentiate newer from older content and to help customers choose the correct topic.

Because of the overlap of subject matter on our sites and the overloading of keywords, it’s important to include the relevant application name (and version, if necessary) in topic titles:

- **Good title**  
  *Improve the relevance of search results in SharePoint*
- **Not-so-good title**  
  *Improving relevance*

## Write a unique and descriptive summary

Always include a summary that describes the topic’s content. It should consist of a sentence or two and summarize what the topic is about. (To avoid truncation, don't exceed a length of 165 characters. The best practice for length is currently 120-160 characters.) Start the summary with a verb (no need for “In this topic” or “This article describes”), and include all relevant short product names and as many relevant keywords as possible.

The summary should elaborate on the purpose of the topic, not just be a wordy version of the title:

- **Good summary**  
  *Learn to convert Word documents to PDF format on the server by using Word Automation Services with SharePoint Server 2019.*
- **Not-so-good summary**  
  *This topic describes one of the first things an “Agave” must do before operating, which is to make sure both the DOM and the “Agave” runtime environment have been loaded.*

## Provide descriptive, keyword-rich headings and subheadings

Write headings and subheadings that are descriptive and keyword rich. Ask yourself this: if users scanned just the headings and subheadings, would they understand the intent of the content?

## Use keywords strategically in the title, summary, and metadata and early in the content

To improve the asset ranking in search engines, add keywords to the most important (heavily weighted) elements—especially the title and description (summary). Use keywords and keyword phrases early and often.

Articles that have a higher frequency of matching keywords have a better chance of ranking higher on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). The position of the first occurrence of the keyword affects the ranking of the page. The earlier that relevant terms appear, the better the ranking position.

Add target keywords to the following parts of the page in a meaningful way:

- The URL or file name, if possible, for a code sample or download.
- The Title
- The summary metadata
- Headings
- The beginning and ending page paragraphs of the content
- Table and figure names
- Alt text for images

For more detailed guidance about how to apply keywords to your content, see [Search and writing](/style-guide/search-writing) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

## Keep keywords and keyword phrases together

Keyword phrases are stronger than keywords alone. If a user enters two or more query terms, Search looks at the proximity of the keywords. The closer together they appear in the content (title, description, and body), the higher the rank.

## Introduce figures, tables, and code examples

Follow these guidelines for figures, tables, and code examples:

- Write an introductory sentence or two to provide context for a figure or table.
- Write descriptive alt text for each figure—preferably about 75-150 characters.
- Precede each code example with a description, and write clear code comments in the example itself.

## Add backlinks FROM other topics to your topic

Links spread “link juice” from higher-visibility pages to lower-visibility pages and add to the overall relevance of a page. Therefore, you need to add links FROM other articles to your article.

Backlinks from pages in the same domain add some value. However, it is valuable to build links from pages from other Microsoft domains or external domains. For example, add links from popular and relevant blogs.

## Make FWLinks permanent

To improve discoverability, add the **/p** option to an FWLink, like this: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=86941.

The addition of the **/p** option changes the link from a temporary (302) link to a permanent (301) link. This is better for SEO and improves the authority of articles from the perspective of search engines. As a result, topics should be easier to find and appear higher in search result rankings.

## Write lean content, organize it clearly, and use an empathic voice

Most importantly, write less—but more engaging—content so the user will want to linger on your page:

- **Good content**  
  *To complete the process, you need to be a member of the Site Owners group.*
- **Not-so-good content**  
  *In order to complete the process, you should ensure that you have requested the appropriate permissions.*

Read your content aloud, and use your editor or another colleague as your first reader. Trust the input you’re given—if your colleague doesn’t understand it, something is wrong.
