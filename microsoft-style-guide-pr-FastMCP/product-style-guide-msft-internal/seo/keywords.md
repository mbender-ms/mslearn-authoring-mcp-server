# Keywords

To start writing keywords, create a logical list of keywords for each article without using any tools. This is the initial brainstorming based on the intent of the article.

> [!TIP]
> Be sure that some of the words in your initial list are parts of the title, and variations of the title. If you donâ€™t think you need to use keywords that are in your title, you might end up realizing that you need to consider changing your title. |

For example, with an article titled Add your users and domain to Office 365, you might start with some keywords based on title:

- Add users Office 365
- Add domain Office 365
- Add users 365
- Add domain 365

You might have other keywords based on the intent:

- Office 365 domain setup
- Office 365 DNS configuration
- Office 365 domain configuration

As an optional (but easy!) step, do actual searches in Google and Bing using some of the terms in your title. Look at the **Related searches** that they have listed. Add some or all of these to your list of candidates.

If Google or Bing doesn't show you a related searches list, you can observe the autocomplete suggestions when you type keywords in the Bing or Google search box. Consider adding those suggested phrases to your keywords list. For example, in this scenario, autocomplete would suggested additional related keyword phrases **office 365 dns settings**, **office 365 smtp dns settings**, and **office 365 dns server settings**.

The most important place to use keywords is in the meta description that is shown on search-engine results pages along with the title of an article. But keywords should be used throughout the body of your content. In general, you can only expect to get good ranking for keywords that are used fairly often in your body content.
