# Global and localization considerations

We want Microsoft 365 products and content to be useful and comprehensible for *all* customers, whether theyâ€™re in different regions or communities or belong to different cultures.

For guidance about how to create content for a worldwide audience, see [Global communications](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/global-communications/) in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*.
