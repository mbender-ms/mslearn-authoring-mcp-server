# Copilot Actions

*Copilot Actions* refers to the Microsoft 365 Copilot feature that allows users to delegate tasks to Copilot. 

An *action* is a multi-step automated task performed by Copilot or another agent in the background, either when scheduled or when triggered by a user or event. It gathers information from one or more sources, then carries out multiple steps immediately or asynchronouslyâ€”ranging from sending reminder notifications to colleagues to creating documents.

**Guidelines**

- First mention: Microsoft 365 Copilot Actions

    - You can omit *Microsoft 365* and shorten to Copilot Actions in UI or when the Microsoft 365 Copilot context is clear

- Subsequent mentions: Actions

When referring to the capability or feature overall, use uppercase *Actions*.

When referring to an individual action, use lowercase *action*.
