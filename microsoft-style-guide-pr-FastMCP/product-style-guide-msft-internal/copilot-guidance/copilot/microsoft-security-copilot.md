# Microsoft Security Copilot

Our paid Copilot offering built for security.

**Guidelines**

First mention​: Microsoft Security Copilot​

Subsequent mentions: ​  
Security Copilot (when security context needs to be clearer)​  

Copilot (when security context is clear enough) ​

When referencing Copilot in embedded experiences (such as Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Purview, or Microsoft Intune), use the construct *Copilot in Foo.*

First mention:  

In general writing, use Copilot in FOO  
In product UI, use Copilot  

Subsequent mentions:  

Copilot in FOO (when the FOO context is unclear)  
Copilot (when the FOO context is clear enough)

Embedded experiences should be treated as features and user experiences, not products or brands. ​

**Examples**

With Security Copilot, you can now do XYZ in Microsoft Entra.

Copilot in Defender now allows you to…  

Microsoft Security Copilot is integrated into many Security products, including Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Sentinel.  

**Do**  

Treat embedded experiences as user experiences, not products.  
Use *Copilot* with descriptive language.  
Describe the context or explain the experience rather than name it.  

**Don’t**  

Treat embedded experiences as brands.  
Constrain yourself to always using *Copilot in Foo* in general writing.  
Use long or wordy names that are not friendly to readers or areas with character limits or in general writing.  

Instead of:  

Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune.  
Copilot in Microsoft Entra, part of Microsoft Security Copilot.  

Try:  

Security Copilot is embedded in Microsoft Intune.  
Microsoft Entra capabilities in Security Copilot.
