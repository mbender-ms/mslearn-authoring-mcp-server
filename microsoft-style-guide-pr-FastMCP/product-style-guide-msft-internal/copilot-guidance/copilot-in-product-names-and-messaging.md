# Copilot in product names and messaging

## Microsoft Copilot experiences
When referring to Microsoft Copilot and associated experiences, use *Copilot* (title-case). Don't use lowercase *copilots*. 

When describing a Microsoft experience, only use *Copilot* to describe experiences that meets the criteria outlined on [Brand Central](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/asset-detail.html?search=Copilot%2Bnaming%2Bbranding%2Bguidance&id=L2NvbnRlbnQvZGFtL3NvdXJjZS9taWNyb3NvZnQtYnJhbmQvZ3VpZGVsaW5lL2NvcGlsb3QtbmFtaW5nLWFuZC1icmFuZGluZy1ndWlkYW5jZQ%3D%3D#downloads). If a Microsoft experience does not meet these criteria, do not use the term *Copilot* to describe it.
  
Don't use *Copilot* as a verb. 

When using *Copilot* to describe a Microsoft experience, don't make *Copilot* plural unless you need to refer multiple Copilot offerings in the same piece of content. 

  **Example**

  - **Instead of this**: Get more done with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft Securirty Copilot, and GitHub Copilot.
  - **Try this**: Get more done with Copilots for work, security, and development.
  - **Or this**: Get more done with Copilot offerings built for work, security, and development.
    
You can use *Copilot* as an adjective describing a plural noun (for example, "Copilot experiences" or "Copilot offerings"). 

It’s OK to use the article *a* with *Copilot*, but not *the*.  

## Third-party, custom agents

You may use the term *agent* to describe third-party interactive, chat-based experiences that respond to natural language prompts and use generative AI to help customers complete tasks. When referring to third-party agents, use *agent* (lowercase).​​  

Don't use the term *copilot.*

**Our style**  
- Turn your words into a powerful productivity tool with help from custom agents.  
- Improve your productivity with custom agents for work.  
- Use an agent to shorten or rewrite copy.   

**Not our style**  
- Use the copilot to generate charts and graphs.   
- Microsoft 365 can copilot your experience.  
- Change the way you work with custom copilots.  

## Microsoft Copilot

Microsoft Copilot is our free commercial Copilot product. Accessible when a user signs in with their Entra ID (work or school account), this offering has enterprise data protection (EDP).  

First mention: Microsoft Copilot  
Subsequent mentions: Copilot  

Use the word *chat* to refer to the chat experience that is included for free in Microsoft Copilot with EDP.  

## Copilot in Microsoft FOO messaging

Use the messaging construct *Copilot in Microsoft Foo* to describe *where* Copilot will be experienced. *Copilot in Microsoft Foo* is not a product name.  

First mention: Copilot in Microsoft Foo  

Subsequent mentions (or when already in the context of Microsoft): Copilot in Foo, Copilot.  

Don't combine *Copilot* with other words to form a name or create a feature name.  

In the product experience, *Copilot* is always named and experienced as *Copilot*. 
 
Do not give *Copilot* features proper noun names. Use messaging to describe the benefit of the feature to the user. Use UI/UX labels and prompts to help users navigate and interact with *Copilot*.  

In messaging, never lock up the word *Copilot* with prompts or UI labels. For example, do not use “Copilot Summarize."
