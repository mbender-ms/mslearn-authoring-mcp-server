# New product and feature names

Sometimes new product and feature names can't be added to the Microsoft Product Style Guide because they haven't been made public. These names are considered embargoed content.

If you're looking for naming guidance or need to confirm an unannounced name has been approved, refer to the Brand Naming team's [monthly naming spreadsheet](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/CloudMarketingNaming271/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4F744D89-6F88-4CB7-BE81-4738D4C9B8D1%7D&file=FY25%20Monthly%20Naming%20News.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&share=IQGJTXRPiG-3TL6BRzjUybjRAXZVM8qapSEuUCUKjv4gf3Y&clickparams=eyAiWC1BcHBOYW1lIiA6ICJNaWNyb3NvZnQgT3V0bG9vayIsICJYLUFwcFZlcnNpb24iIDogIjE2LjAuMTg3MzAuMjAwMzAiLCAiT1MiIDogIldpbmRvd3MiIH0%3D&CID=42AA76EB-96FE-4EA8-A066-057D7C77AFD7&wdLOR=cDF011CE5-0182-431C-8DBE-4B9F5D6A0965). This spreadsheet includes:

- Guidance for first and subsequent mentions
- The tentative announcement date
- The name of the Product Marketing Manager who submitted the name

Keep in mind that announcement dates are tentative, and occasionally new product and features can be delayed. Always confirm whether the new product or feature has been publicly released before referring to it externally.

If you have questions or need further clarification, visit the [Naming Central website](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CloudMarketingNamingCentral/SitePages/Home.aspx) or contact the Product Marketing Manager listed in the spreadsheet.

Once the name is public, it will be added to the Product Style Guide.
