# Basic attribution guidelines

This topic outlines basic usage guidelines for the Microsoft 365 name and the apps that are included in Microsoft 365. For information about a specific app or SKU name, see the [A–Z names and terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md).

## References to Microsoft 365 

When referring to the Microsoft 365 brand name or any of the individual SKUs, follow these guidelines:

- Always include *Microsoft;* don’t shorten to just *365.* 
- Always spell out *Microsoft 365.* Don’t abbreviate the name or create acronyms such as *M365.* 
- When you’re referring to Microsoft 365 for a specific audience, the correct references are:
  - Microsoft 365 for business
  - Microsoft 365 for enterprise
  - Microsoft 365 for family
  - Microsoft 365 for education

  Note that these aren’t specific products or plans, but rather how we talk collectively about Microsoft 365 offerings that are aimed at those specific audiences.

- Use title-style capitalization when you’re referring to a specific Microsoft 365 SKU by name. For a list, see [Microsoft 365 SKU names](~/product-and-feature-names/microsoft-365-sku-names.md). For information about a specific app or SKU name, see that topic in the [A–Z names and terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md).
- Always use numerals for *365;* don’t spell out the number. Always include a space between *Microsoft* and *365.*
- In speech, the correct pronunciation in English is “Microsoft three sixty-five” or “Microsoft three six five," not “three hundred sixty-five.” 
- Never separate *Microsoft* from *365.* They should always appear on the same line.

## When to include *Microsoft* in app names

When referring to the apps that are part of Microsoft 365, follow these guidelines.

In content created by Microsoft:

- App and service names that are generic, such as Access and Forms, must include *Microsoft* in the first mention—for example, in the first mention in an article, webpage, or error message.
- Names that aren’t generic, such as Kaizala, PowerPoint, and InfoPath, need to include *Microsoft* in the first mention only when the Microsoft logo isn’t present.

In content created by third parties:

- All app and service names, both generic names and those that aren’t generic, must include *Microsoft* in the first mention—for example, in the first mention in an article, webpage, or error message.

Exceptions:

- Microsoft Teams has unique guidelines for when *Microsoft* should be included and when it can be omitted. See [Microsoft Teams](~/a_z_names_terms/m/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams.md) in the A–Z list for details.
- Acquired products, such as Skype and Yammer, never include *Microsoft* in their names. In third-party communications and in Microsoft content when the logo isn’t present, attribute these products to Microsoft by saying something like “Skype, a Microsoft product” or “GroupMe, by Microsoft.”
- In both Microsoft and third-party communications, the names Microsoft Editor, Microsoft Family Safety, Microsoft Lens, Microsoft Lists, Microsoft To Do, and Microsoft Stream must always include *Microsoft* in the name. Exceptions include usage in the system tray, in the mobile start screen, and when mentioned multiple times in the same paragraph.  
  **Note:** Microsoft Editor must include *Microsoft* in the name only when shown in an app store experience or when referring to the standalone app for a browser. It can be referred to as *Editor* when referencing a feature inside another app, such as Word or Microsoft Edge.

## References to platform and purchase model

In general, Microsoft 365 and Office products no longer include the platform as part of the name (for example, don't use *Office Online,* *Office Mobile, Microsoft 365 Online, or Microsoft 365 Mobile*). If you need to distinguish the app on one platform from another, use messaging instead.

**Exception**  
The server products related to Microsoft 365 and Office still include the platform reference—for example, Project Server, Project Online, Exchange Server, and Exchange Online.

Specifically:

- Just use the app name and avoid referring to a platform unless you’re talking about functionality that’s specific to that platform.  
  **Examples**  
  The modern comments experience aligns the commenting experience in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  
  This feature is currently available only in Word for the web.
- The phrase *for the web* is the descriptor for the Microsoft 365 web apps to distinguish them from their desktop counterparts.  
  **Examples**  
  Word for the web  
  PowerPoint for the web
- The Microsoft 365 app for mobile devices (formally called the Office app) is a single app that combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The phrase *for mobile devices* is the descriptor for the first mention of a Microsoft 365 product included in the Microsoft 365 app, such as "Word for mobile devices." Subsequent mentions can be shortened to *mobile,* such as "Word mobile."
- Don't use *desktop* as a descriptor, such as "Word desktop." If you need to differentiate desktop experiences from mobile ones, you can use *for the desktop* as a descriptor. 
- When you need to distinguish a subscription version of an app from one in a perpetual edition:
  - For the subscription version: use the app name plus *in Microsoft 365.*
  - For the app in a perpetual edition: use the app name plus the version year.  
 **Examples**  
 Excel in Microsoft 365  
 Excel in Microsoft 365 for Mac  
 Excel 2021  
 Excel 2019 for Windows
