# Office to Microsoft 365 transition  

Microsoft 365 is now the lead brand for Microsoft’s modern, cloud-enabled productivity solutions. Office is no longer a brand within Microsoft 365, nor is it associated with the modern, subscription-based productivity solutions.  

**Guidelines**  

Most instances of Office will need to transition to the Microsoft 365 brand, including:  

- All cloud-enabled desktop, web, and mobile apps will be referred to as apps in Microsoft 365 and not Office apps. When describing these apps, general terms such as *productivity apps*, *apps*, or *apps in Microsoft 365* are preferred over *Microsoft 365 apps*, in order to avoid confusion with *Microsoft 365 Apps* (the SKU name). Or list out the specific app names, such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.  
- Office.com will be renamed microsoft365.com.  
- The all-in-one Office app (including versions for Windows, iOS, and Android) will be renamed the Microsoft 365 app.  
- General reference to the productivity solutions (social media handles, etc.) should use Microsoft 365 (instead of Office).  
- Over-arching programs using the Office brand (Office Insiders, etc.) will be changed to Microsoft 365.  

**Exceptions**  

- Perpetual versions of the productivity apps (Microsoft Office LTSC, Microsoft Office 2021, etc.) remain the same.  
- All SKUs that use the Office name (Microsoft Office Home and Student, Office 365 E3, etc.) continue to use the Office brand.  
- Some specialized tools and services, including Office Scripts, Office Deployment Tool, and Office Customization Tool, are not changing their names (as of February 2023).  

## How to distinguish between a Microsoft 365 and an Office app  

- Any app that is sold as a subscription is a Microsoft 365 app.  
- Any app that is sold through a one-time purchase is an Office app.  
- A desktop app could be a Microsoft 365 app or an Office app, depending on how it is acquired. When describing both app types together, use Microsoft 365 as the brand descriptor, or use the specific app name instead, such as Word or PowerPoint.  
- The web apps (accessed at microsoft365.com as of 11/7/22) are always apps in Microsoft 365 (even if used under the free offering).  
- The mobile apps are generally considered to be apps in Microsoft 365, but could still be used by Office (non-subscription) users with limited functionality.  

## Terminology to use  

- **Microsoft 365**: Microsoft’s productivity solution/suite unless it is exclusively referencing the perpetual version of the productivity apps.  
- **Office**: Microsoft’s suite of perpetual productivity apps, which are not cloud-enabled and are sold through a one-time purchase.  
- The **Microsoft 365 app** (formerly Office app): the app experience that can be used on the web, Windows, and mobile, including:  
  - **Microsoft365.com** or **Microsoft 365 app for the web** or **Microsoft 365 web app**: the web version of the Microsoft 365 app.  
  - **Microsoft 365 app for Windows**: the Windows desktop version of the app.  
  - **Microsoft 365 mobile app** or **Microsoft 365 app for mobile/iOS/Android**: the mobile version of the Microsoft 365 app.  
- A **Microsoft 365 app**: this is acceptable, but not the preferred way to describe the individual apps included in any Microsoft 365 subscription. Where possible, substitute general terms such as *productivity apps* or *apps in Microsoft 365*, or list the specific apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) to avoid confusion with Microsoft 365 Apps (the SKU name).  
- An **Office app**: used to describe an app (Outlook, Word, etc.) as the legacy, perpetual version of it.  
- **Install Microsoft 365** or **Install apps**: replace all "Install Office" calls to action unless referring to a non-subscription version.  
- **Microsoft 365 files**: replaces "Office files." Refer to the specific file type (if known), such as Word, Excel, etc.  

**Note** the difference between *the* Microsoft 365 app and *a* Microsoft 365 app. *The* Microsoft 365 app refers to the overall app experience, while *a* Microsoft 365 app can refer to an individual app, like Word or PowerPoint (but this is not a preferred way to describe the individual apps. See above). The definite (the) or indefinite (a, an) articles are not part of the name and are not required when mentioned as long as it is clear which term is referenced.  

## Terminology not to use  

- **Office.com**: the URL will redirect to Microsoft365.com, but no longer direct people to office.com.  
- **The Office app**: this has become the Microsoft 365 app. There is no longer a standalone app called Office.  
- **Office apps** (to refer to the subscription versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint): refer to these as apps in Microsoft 365, or list them out (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) If you are referring to the perpetual Office license, no changes are needed.  
- **M365**: never use this abbreviation externally.  
- **Office files**: refer to the files created by the productivity apps as “Microsoft 365 files” instead of “Office files,” since the same file extensions are used by both the subscription and perpetual versions. When possible, refer to them according to the specific app (Word document, PowerPoint presentation, etc.).
