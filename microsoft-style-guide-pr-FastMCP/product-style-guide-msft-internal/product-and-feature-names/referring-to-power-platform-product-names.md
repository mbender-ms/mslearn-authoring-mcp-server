# Referring to Power Platform product names

## Product and service names

Look up detailed guidelines for individual product names in the list of [A–Z names + terms.](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md)

## How to refer to Microsoft Power Platform

Include *Microsoft* whenever possible. If space constraints make it impossible to include *Microsoft,* include it at least on the first mention and on all prominent references. Don't include *the.* It's *Microsoft Power Platform,* not *the Microsoft Power Platform.*

**See also** [Microsoft Power Platform](~/a_z_names_terms/m/microsoft-power-platform.md) in the list of [A–Z names + terms.](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md)

## When to include *Microsoft* in references to specific apps

In general, when you’re referring to apps such as Power Apps and Power BI, use the full product name shown in the table on the first mention in body text. The approved short form can be used in a headline, heading, or similar text if the full name appears immediately after it in body text.

On the first mention, you can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the app name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

In places where space is limited, it's OK to omit *Microsoft,* but be sure that the Microsoft brand is referenced in some other way, such as the Microsoft logo. We must always be sure to associate these apps with Microsoft.

## When to include *Power* in references to specific apps

Always include *Power* in references to Power BI, Power Apps, and the other Microsoft Power Platform apps.

## Abbreviations and acronyms

Don't abbreviate any of the Microsoft Power Platform names or turn them into acronyms. For more information, see [Acronyms + abbreviations.](~/acronyms-and-abbreviations.md)

## Platform descriptors

Many Power Platform products are available as web and mobile apps as well as desktop applications. In the past, words like *Mobile* and *Desktop* were included in the product name to signal which platform the app runs on.

**Going forward, however, we don’t include the platform as part of the product name.** Most of the time, you’ll just refer to the main app name, like Power Automate or Power Apps. When you need to reference the platform—for example, when you’re discussing functionality that’s available in the desktop app but not the mobile app—include a descriptive phrase or messaging that indicates the platform.

**Exception**  
For the time being, Power BI apps will continue to include the platform descriptor as part of the formal product name. See [Power BI](~/a_z_names_terms/p/power-bi.md) for correct usage of Power BI names.

When you do include a platform descriptor, use the wording that’s most appropriate and natural sounding for the context and most meaningful for the target audience. Here are some ways to do that:

- Add a phrase such as *for the desktop* after the app name. Examples of other appropriate phrases are *web, mobile, desktop, web app, mobile app, desktop app, for mobile devices,* and *for the desktop.*
- Introduce functionality with wording like this: “When you’re using Power Automate on a mobile device ….”
- Refer to the type of app, as in “the Power Automate mobile app,” “the Power Automate desktop app,” or “the Power Automate web app.”
- Always lowercase platform messaging like *mobile app* and *for the desktop.* It’s OK to use the appropriate capitalization for iOS, Android, and Windows when you’re referring to the development platform.

- When your audience is business users, focus on the device or the app. When your audience is developers, it might be more appropriate to reference the underlying platform. For example, with business users, you might talk about using Power Automate on their iPhone, but with developers, you might talk about developing on iOS instead.
- In the UI, references to the platform will be more structured and consistent, so that we can convey this information succinctly and in the clearest way possible. For example, we say *for desktop* rather than *for the desktop* to accommodate space constraints.
