# Referring to Azure product names

## Product and service names

Look up detailed guidelines for individual product names in the list of [A–Z names + terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md).

## When to include *Microsoft*

Always see individual product topics to determine guidelines for specific products. Some product names, such as [HDInsight](~/a_z_names_terms/h/hdinsight.md), require *Microsoft* only on first mention. Some product names, such as [Microsoft Graph](~/a_z_names_terms/m/microsoft-graph.md), require *Microsoft* with all mentions. And some don’t use *Microsoft* at all, such as [Windows Admin Center](~/a_z_names_terms/w/windows-admin-center.md).

## When to include *Azure*

Always see individual product topics to determine guidelines for specific products. Some product names, such as [Logic Apps](~/a_z_names_terms/l/logic-apps-logic-app.md), require *Azure* only on first mention. Some product names, such as [Azure Cosmos DB](~/a_z_names_terms/a/azure-cosmos-db.md), require *Azure* with all mentions. And some don’t use *Azure* at all, such as [Microsoft Graph](~/a_z_names_terms/m/microsoft-graph.md).

When you're mentioning several Azure services, it's OK to add *Azure* to just the first service mentioned.

Example: Azure HDInsight, Mobile Services, and Storage

If the full name Microsoft Azure doesn't appear elsewhere in the communication, the first reference to the first Azure service should include *Microsoft*.

Example: Microsoft Azure HDInsight, Mobile Services, and Storage

It's never incorrect to include *Azure* in a reference to an Azure service name if you think it adds clarity or helps reinforce the Azure brand name.

Example: Build logic apps with Azure Logic Apps.

Likewise, you don't have to use the short form of the name listed in these guidelines on the subsequent mentions. But using the short form usually contributes to a friendlier, more human tone.

## In Azure vs. on Azure

For information about whether to use *in Azure* or *on Azure* in reference to Azure features and functionality, see [in Azure vs. on Azure](~/a_z_names_terms/i/in-azure-vs-on-azure.md) in the list of [A–Z names + terms](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md).

See [Capitalization standards](~/capitalization-standards/capitalization-standards.md) for more information about how to capitalize individual instances and feature names, and about capitalization style in general.
