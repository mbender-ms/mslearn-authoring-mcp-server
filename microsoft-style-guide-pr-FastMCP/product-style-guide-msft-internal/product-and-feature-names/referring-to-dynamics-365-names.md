# Referring to Dynamics 365 names

Our commercial brand strategy is Microsoft led, which delivers consistency and perception lift across the portfolio. That's why it's critical to use the full and complete name prominently and on the first mention.

Look up individual product names in the list of [A–Z names + terms.](~/a_z_names_terms/az-names-and-terms.md)

## How to refer to the overall Dynamics 365 brand

First mention: Microsoft Dynamics 365

You can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

Subsequent mentions: Dynamics 365

In places where space is limited, it's OK to omit *Microsoft,* but be sure that the Microsoft brand is referenced in some other way, such as the Microsoft logo. We must always be sure to associate Dynamics 365 with Microsoft.

When a descriptor for the suite is needed, use "intelligent business applications."

## When to include *Microsoft* in references to specific apps

In general, use the full product name shown in the table on the first mention in body text. The approved short form can be used in a headline, heading, or similar text if the full name appears immediately after it in body text.

On the first mention, you can omit *Microsoft* if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- The Microsoft logo appears in proximity to the Dynamics 365 name—like on the same screen or surface.
- The word *Microsoft* has already been used in text earlier in the communication—like in an earlier reference to a product name.

In places where space is limited, it's OK to omit *Microsoft,* but be sure that the Microsoft brand is referenced in some other way, such as the Microsoft logo. We must always be sure to associate Dynamics 365 with Microsoft.

## When to include *Dynamics 365* in references to specific apps

Once you've associated the product name with Dynamics 365—typically on the first reference in body text—you can omit *Dynamics 365.*

Note, however, that for legal or branding reasons, some names—such as Dynamics 365 Remote Assist—always have to include *Dynamics 365.*

## Abbreviations and acronyms

Don't abbreviate any of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 names or turn them into acronyms. (For more information, see [Acronyms + abbreviations](~/acronyms-and-abbreviations.md).) In particular, never abbreviate the name to *D365.* Microsoft doesn't own this trademark.

Always use numerals for *365.*

## How to present Dynamics 365 in relation to Office 365

Specifically in the context of Office 365, use the shortened name *Dynamics 365* without *Microsoft.* In a visual environment, include the Microsoft logo in close proximity but not preceding either the Office 365 or Dynamics 365 name.
