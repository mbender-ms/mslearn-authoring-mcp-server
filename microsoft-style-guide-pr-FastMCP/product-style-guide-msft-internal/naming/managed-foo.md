# Managed FOO

In the Azure family of names, specifically, the *managed FOO* construct, as in Microsoft Azure Managed FOO is used to specify instances where the third-party solutions are hosted on and integrated with Azure.  
**Examples**:  

- Azure Managed Lustre  
- Azure Managed Grafana  
- Azure Managed Prometheus  
- Azure Managed Spring  

This is an exception to the current third-party naming guidelines that require a *for FOO* construct used to signal that the subject is a Microsoft offering, created to work with third-party offerings.
