# Feature naming process

**Product Marketing drives marketing names**

Features that will be backed by significant marketing investment will often require a name for go-to-market purposes. If your feature needs a marketing name, follow the process found on [Cloud Marketing Naming Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CloudMarketingNamingCentral/SitePages/Home.aspx).

**Product Design drives UI labels**

Content Designers on product design teams are responsible for crafting the most effective terms for in-product UI labels. Content Designers ensure that UI content is aligned to our existing brand vocabulary, adheres to Microsoft voice principles, and is optimized for user needs.

**Process for UI labels**

- If the Product Design team has a Content Designer: They lead in-product UI labels as a fundamental part of designing the interactions and interface. 
- If a Product Design team does not have a Content Designer yet: The Design Manager takes the lead, often with the support of the Product Manager.
