# Marketing handles

Not a name but rather a term or phrase used to refer to a set of related offerings in marketing alone.

Descriptive and consisting of one or two words. Typically uses sentence-style casing (lowercase), but not always.

No marketing handle can be used in product feature names or UI labels.

**Examples**

- Microsoft Cloud
- Microsoft AI
- business applications
- copilot (Power Platform only)
