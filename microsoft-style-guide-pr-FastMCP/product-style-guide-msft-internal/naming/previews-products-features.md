# Previews (products, features)

A *preview* is a prerelease product or feature that’s made available to customers for evaluation purposes at reduced or different service terms. 

**Guidelines**

lowercase (sentence-style casing) 

- Do not use beta to refer to a prerelease product or feature that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Use preview instead.
- Do not use public preview or private preview. Use preview instead.  

## In marketing content

- When referring to a specific product in preview by name in regular text, say in marketing content: 
- Use [Product Name] Preview (preferred) or [Code Name] Preview (if the final name hasn't been announced yet) on the first mention in the body and in each major section. 
- If the context is clear, subsequent mentions in each major section can omit the word Preview. 
- Don’t include Public or Private in references to a specific preview product. For example, use [Product Name] Preview, not [Product Name] Public Preview. If you need to clarify whether the preview is available to the public or not, include that in the accompanying text. 
- It is OK to use the term limited preview in marketing content, as in "Copilot features in Dynamics 365 Customer Service are in limited preview."

## When referring to a product in preview in the UI

- The preferred treatment is to include Preview after the product name in the launch screen. Include the pipe symbol ( | ) before Preview to make it clear the status isn't part of the product name.

![preview 2](~/media/1800748390.png)

- When Preview is included in the launch screen, it doesn’t need to appear in the product header. 
- In the rare cases when Preview doesn’t appear in the launch screen, include it in the product header, right after the product name. Don’t include the pipe symbol ( | ), but the word Preview is set in a color tint to make it clear the status isn’t part of the product name.

**Note:** Use this treatment only when Preview doesn’t appear in the launch screen.

- Don’t include Public or Private in the launch screen or product header. If you need to clarify whether the preview is available to the public or not, include that in the accompanying messages or text. 
- Don't use limited preview (or any other type of preview) in product UI. Instead use preview only. 

## Feature previews (with Copilot and without, in UI and elsewhere)

In UI, when referring to a specific feature that’s in preview:

- In UI without Copilot, use the pill with label: “PREVIEW”.
- In UI with Copilot, use the pill with label “PREVIEW FEATURE” to communicate that what’s in preview is this feature, not all of Copilot. 

In narrative text in UI or elsewhere, follow the first feature reference with “(preview)” lowercase and in parentheses. Example: “Features this month include quick measures (preview) ...”

## Generic preview references

For generic references to previews, use lowercase preview. Use in preview to distinguish features that aren’t yet generally available from those that have been released.

**Examples**

Azure may include features and services that are in preview. Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the terms of use.
