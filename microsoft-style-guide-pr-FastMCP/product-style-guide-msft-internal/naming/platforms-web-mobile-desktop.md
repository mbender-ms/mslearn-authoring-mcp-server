# Platforms: web, mobile, desktop

Our products are often available on the web and the desktop and mobile devices. However, the platform descriptor isn't part of the product name.  
Product names should not include the platform, as in *Power Automate Desktop, Power Apps Mobile,* or *Dynamics 365 Sales Mobile.*  

- If you need to distinguish the app on one platform from another, use messaging instead. For example, "Open the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app quickly when you're on the go."

- Platform terms include *web, mobile, desktop, web app, mobile app,* and *desktop app.* Do not title case.

- Always lowercase platform messaging like *mobile app* and *for the desktop.* It's OK to use the appropriate capitalization for iOS, Android, and Windows when you’re referring to the development platform.

**Our style**  
Get the mobile app for Microsoft Azure.  
Open the Power Apps desktop app.  
Try the mobile app for Power Automate.  
Get quick and easy access to all your important business info, wherever you are, with the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app.  

**Not our style**  
Get Microsoft Azure Mobile.  
Open Power Apps Desktop.  
Try Power Automate mobile.  
Get quick and easy access to all your important business info, wherever you are, with Dynamics 365 Sales Mobile.

**Exceptions**  
For the time being, we’ll continue to use the names Power BI Desktop and Power BI Mobile.
