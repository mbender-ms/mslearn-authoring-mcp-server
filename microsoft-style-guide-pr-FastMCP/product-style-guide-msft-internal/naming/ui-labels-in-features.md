# UI labels in features

**Product Design drives UI labels**

Product Design is accountable to define feature names and design UI labels, consulting with Cloud Marketing's Brand team and Product Marketing as needed. Content Designers on the product team understand the space, design the feature flows, and run user research studies.

**Why we use descriptive UI labels instead of feature names**

_UI labels focused on the capability or next step work better than feature names._

In most cases, there’s no need to refer to features by a unique name. In fact, it’s almost always clearer to describe functionality and guide users with natural language and consistent terminology. Use descriptive conversational language to talk about features—keeping the focus on what users can accomplish.

**Designing UI labels in product**

Labels have one overriding goal: guide users to intuitively understand and readily complete steps in a task or workflow.

Guidelines:

- Design each UI label around the user’s intention and their next step.
- Label the functionality clearly using consistent terms that help the user make decisions confidently.
- Choose descriptive conversational words and keep the focus on what users can accomplish.

**Talking about product features elsewhere**

In marketing webpages, blogs, docs, decks, and other long-form copy, we use descriptive conversational language to talk about features—keeping the focus on what users can accomplish.
