# Naming

Naming is perhaps the most complex activity in all of brand marketing. This section covers the following naming topics:

- [Name types + patterns](~\naming\name-types--patterns.md) (The brand nomenclature system with name patterns by type)
- [Product naming process](~\naming\product-naming-process.md)
- [Feature naming process](~\naming\feature-naming-process.md)
- [Platforms: web, mobile, desktop](~\naming\platforms-web-mobile-desktop.md)
- [Code names](~\naming\code-names.md)
- [Preview,](~/a_z_names_terms/p/preview.md)
- [Versions](~\naming\versions.md)
- [Marketing handles](~\naming\marketing-handles.md)
- [Managed FOO](~\naming\managed-foo.md)
- [UI labels in features](~\naming\ui-labels-in-features.md)

To look up a name, see the list of [Aâ€“Z names + terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md).

For information about the role of industry terms in Microsoft product naming, see [Industry terms](~\grammar-usage\industry-terms-industry-standard-terms.md).
