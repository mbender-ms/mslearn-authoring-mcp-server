# Name types + patterns

This is our brand nomenclature system and naming architecture. All new products, services, add-ins, features, and in-app components, or other offerings must adhere to these exec-approved definitions and patterns. (Product Marketing Managers wishing to engage the Brand Naming team on a new product naming effort should see Cloud Marketing's [Naming Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CloudMarketingNamingCentral) site.)

| Type of name | Definition | Name pattern | Examples |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **product** | A piece of standalone functionality that Microsoft takes to market as a commodity. Examples include services and applications. <br/><br/> (Standalone is defined as able to operate independently of other software.) | *See patterns for services and applications in the next row.* <br/><br/>Title case. | - Microsoft Azure Machine Learning <br/>- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines <br/>- Microsoft Power Automate <br/>- Microsoft Power Virtual Agents <br/>- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales |
| **service or application** | A product that provides standalone functionality and is available to customers by subscription or license. After it's generally available, it has an SLA and can have metering (if it isn't free) and status reporting.<br/><br/> (Standalone is defined as able to operate independently of other software.) | Azure:<br/> Microsoft Azure [Foo] <br/><br/>Power Platform: <br/>Microsoft Power [Foo] <br/><br/>Dynamics 365: <br/>Microsoft Dynamics 365 [Foo] <br/><br/>Title case. | - Microsoft Azure Machine Learning <br/>- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines <br/>- Microsoft Power Automate <br/>- Microsoft Power Virtual Agents <br/>- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales |
| **instance** | Something the customer builds by using a Microsoft service or application. <br/><br/>Note: This usage of *instance* is different from how *instance* is used in Dynamics 365. | The generic term for the thing built using an Azure service. <br/><br/>Lowercase (sentence-style casing). | - virtual machine <br/>- virtual network <br/>- IoT hub <br/>- managed instance <br/>- elastic database pool |
| **add-in** | An optional, installed functionality that adds features/functionality to an existing product.

| **feature or component** | A product component (not standalone) that provides a specific capability. | A self-evident word or short phrase that describes the functionality. <br/><br/>Lowercase (sentence-style casing). | - studio <br/>- hub <br/>- center, admin center <br/>- elastic pool <br/>- dataflows <br/>- app-assigned address <br/>- process advisor |

| **module** | An integrated app component that extends an underlying product with specific functions and processes. Modules cannot function on their own, and a subscription to the underlying product is required. | A self-evident word or short phrase that describes the functionality.
