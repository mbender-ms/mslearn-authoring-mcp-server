# Versions


| **Product**  | **Guideline**      |  
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Azure        | Azure and the names of Azure services aren't versioned. <br/>Don't use release or version numbers in customer-facing content.    |  
| Dynamics 365 | Use the terms *version* and *update* correctly. <br/> - Use *version* for major releases, such as Dynamics 365 Sales. <br/> - Use *update* for a cumulative update, an out-of-band release, or any release that's considered a minor version change. <br/><br/> Don't include a version number unless it's important information for the customer—for example, when you're comparing the functionality of different versions or discussing compatibility. <br/><br/> **Examples** <br/> - When you compare a current version to previous versions, write this as “what's new in the current version of ….” <br/> - When you refer to features that haven't been implemented yet, write this as “this feature isn't implemented in the current update of ….” <br/><br/> Try not to refer to features as being "new in this version" or to functionality as "starting in this release" unless you're writing about features for “What's new” content. <br/><br/> Don't use "or later" to refer to multiple versions. Instead, list each applicable version. You can use "or earlier" to refer to all versions of a product that precede a particular version if the statement is accurate for all previous versions. |
