# Product naming process

**Cloud Marketing drives product naming**

Naming is led by Cloud Marketing's Brand Naming group. If you need a new name developed for a new product, service, or high-level program, immediately contact them at [cmnaming@microsoft.com](mailto:cmnaming@microsoft.com).

To learn about our naming strategy and the process for getting a name approved, visit [Cloud Marketing Naming Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CloudMarketingNamingCentral).

Developing, clearing, and launching a new product name can require weeks and sometimes months from start to finish. Plan time for required reviews, clearance, and approval by the Cloud Marketing Naming Council, [the CELA Trademark group](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-get-a-name-or-logo-approved.aspx), as well as [localizability and globalization review](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness/SitePages/NewNameReview.aspx) by the Microsoft Global Readiness group followed by final exec approval.

**Note:** Searching potential domain names is handled by Cloud Marketing Naming team as part of the naming process. If your product is in development, donâ€™t conduct WHOIS searches yourself to find out about potential domains, as that traffic can be detected, and those domains snapped up (as well as potentially leaking product plans).
