# Art and video

Images and video can provide several benefits:

- **Help** the user to learn and retain information. 
- **Show** **relationships** in a more direct way than a lengthy paragraph or topic does. 
- **Highlight** the most essential or important information. 
- **Illustrate** the product UI. It’s often hard to imagine the UI from a text description alone.
- **Explain** a confusing procedure or one that has numerous steps.

When you’re deciding whether to include art or video in your content, consider who the customer is and what they want to do.

- **Who is the audience?** For example, how much experience do they have with the product? What is their educational background? How big is their organization and what’s their role in it? 
- **What’s the intent of the audience** when they read your content? What goal are they trying to achieve? How can art serve this intent?
- **What do you want the audience to be able to do** by using your content? For example, should they be able to complete a specific task? Learn concepts about the product? Manage an environment for other users?

If you decide that art is appropriate for your topic, choose the type of art that best serves your customer’s intent. 

**Where to start**

- To help you decide what type of art is the most appropriate to convey your message, see the [Images and video](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/images-video/images-and-video) articles in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.
- For information about how to create art for Marvel end-user experiences (help and how-to content), see the [MARVEL Content Cookbook](https://microsoft.sharepoint-df.com/teams/MARVELContentCreators/SitePages/Home.aspx). 
- A collection of illustrations, photos, screenshots, and other images already exists and is available for use in your content. See the [Microsoft 365 Elements](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/Our-products-Microsoft-365-Elements.aspx) pages on Brand Central to learn what assets are available and how to use them.
- If you need to create new art or video for digital events, paid media, and other marketing and advertising experiences, engage with the Brand Visual Studio.
- Remember that all images and video must be accessible and appropriate for all audiences and follow legal guidelines. See these sections in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide:
