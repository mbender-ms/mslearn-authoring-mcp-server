# Don't humanize AI

Avoid describing AI systems as having human traits or capabilities. For example, don’t suggest an AI system understands language, or that AI can think, reason, see, sense, feel, or experience. It is not possible for AI to be sentient or develop consciousness: AI consists of mathematically engineered systems that use given sets of human-defined objectives and real-world data to make predictions or recommendations; these systems influence the environments they interact with through varying levels of automation.  

Don’t compare an AI system’s performance with levels of human intelligence or describe an AI system as achieving human parity. These terms are often used in academic literature but are not recommended for other communication about AI systems because using anthropomorphic language contributes to misunderstandings about the capabilities and limitations of AI.

Note, communicating responsibly about AI encompasses appropriate choices of words *and* images. Visual content, like written, should avoid humanizing AI. See [Top tips for visuals representing AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips-for-visuals-representing-ai.md) to learn more.
