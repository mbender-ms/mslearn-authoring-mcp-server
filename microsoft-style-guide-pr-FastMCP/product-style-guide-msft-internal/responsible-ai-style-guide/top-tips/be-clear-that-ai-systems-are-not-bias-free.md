# Be clear that AI systems are not bias-free

[It is **not** possible to fully “de-bias” a system or “guarantee” fairness.](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\fairness-in-ai.md)

Communicate that teams tasked with developing and deploying AI systems should instead work to **identify, measure, and mitigate fairness-related harms** as much as possible. (See [Talking about measuring fairness-related harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\related-harms\talking-about-measuring-fairness-related-harms.md) and [Talking about mitigating fairness-related harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\related-harms\talking-about-mitigating-fairness-related-harms.md).)
