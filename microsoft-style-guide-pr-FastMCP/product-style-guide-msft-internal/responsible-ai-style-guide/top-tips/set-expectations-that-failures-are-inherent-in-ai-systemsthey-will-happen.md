# Set expectations that failures are inherent in AI systems—they will happen

Failures in AI systems *will* happen. Discuss limitations and [harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\harms.md) with [transparency](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\transparency\transparency-in-ai.md). 

AI combines information about people and the physical world into mathematical constructs. Such technologies typically rely on statistical methods, with the possibility for errors throughout an AI system’s lifespan.
