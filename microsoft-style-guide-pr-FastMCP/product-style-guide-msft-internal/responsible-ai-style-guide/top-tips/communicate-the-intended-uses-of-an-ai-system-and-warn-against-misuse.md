# Communicate the intended uses of an AI system and warn against misuse

*[_Intended uses_](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\intended-uses.md)* are the primary purposes for which customers, partners, or end users are expected to use an AI system. State clearly what the intended uses of an AI system are and warn against the misuse of the system. See [_Uses of AI_](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\uses-ai-terms\uses-of-aiterms-for-categories-of-ai-use.md) for appropriate language to describe different categories of AI systemsâ€™ use.
