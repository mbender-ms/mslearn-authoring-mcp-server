# Be clear it is not always feasible for AI systems to identify latent human characteristics

Clarify that it is **not always feasible for AI systems to identify latent human characteristics that are subjective human experiences,** such as emotion, gender, sexual orientation, race, or other latent and unobservable human characteristics.  

Predictions about unobservable phenomena like emotion, gender, race are measured by observable proxies such as facial muscle movement, hair length, or [skin color](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\skin-color.md). Often these proxies correlate poorly with the characteristics they attempt to measure. For example, detecting someoneâ€™s age through speech detection or classifying emotion through facial analysis cannot be done responsibly because proxies do not accommodate the diversity of human variation.
