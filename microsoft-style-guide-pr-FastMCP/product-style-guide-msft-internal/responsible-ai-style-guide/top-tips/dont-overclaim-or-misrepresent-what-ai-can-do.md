# Don't overclaim or misrepresent what AI can do

Be precise when explaining what an AI system can and cannot do. There is growing regulatory attention to ensuring that claims made about AI are accurate. Misrepresenting what AI can do is a problem regulatory bodies like the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\f\federal-trade-commission-ftc.md) are concerned with, for prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices. [Transparency](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\transparency\transparency-in-ai.md), a Microsoft AI principle, helps build appropriate trust with [stakeholders](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\stakeholders.md). (See more about [making claims in advertising and marketing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-claims.aspx).)

## Avoid AI hype.

Do not use hyperbole— for example, do not use terms like *magic*—when describing AI systems or their processes, outputs, or user experience. Empowering stakeholders to develop appropriate levels of trust in AI is a goal of responsible AI ([source](https://www.microsoft.com/research/uploads/prod/2022/06/Aether-Overreliance-on-AI-Review-Final-6.21.22.pdf)); hyperbole can lead to inappropriate levels of trust and [overreliance](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\o\overreliance.md) on AI. See [Top tip: Set expectations that failures are inherent in AI systems](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\set-expectations-that-failures-are-inherent-in-ai-systemsthey-will-happen.md)—they *will* fail.
