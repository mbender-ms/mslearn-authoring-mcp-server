# Clarify that AI systems are not neutral

Make audiences aware that the [sociotechnical](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\sociotechnical.md) nature of AI systems will reflect the assumptions, priorities, and values of the people involved in the systems’ development and deployment. Models can also reflect societal biases and undesirable content that is present in the training data, and can therefore behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive.
