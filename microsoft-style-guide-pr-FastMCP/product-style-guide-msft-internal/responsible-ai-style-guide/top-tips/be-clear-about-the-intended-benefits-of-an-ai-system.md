# Be clear about the intended benefits of an AI system

Communicate that when designed responsibly, AI systems are intended to augment human performance and assist people, not displace people.

For example:

- Do not use language that implies AI systems make decisions; in the responsible use of AI, people should be in the role of decision makers. Instead, use terms like *AI system recommendations* or *predictions.*  
- Be concrete about an AI system’s intended benefits and specify the groups of people who will benefit.
- Be aware of societal sensitivities about potential job loss due to automation. For example, when discussing automation of tasks—say, a robot analyzing a hazardous spill—specify what the benefits are and who will benefit.
