# Acknowledgments and references

This style guide originated in the [Aether Fairness and Inclusiveness working group](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/Aether/SitePages/Fairness-and-Inclusiveness.aspx). The work has since expanded to reflect growing guidance for how to talk responsibly about AI in general, with input from all Aether working groups as well as other subject matter experts in technology, the social sciences, and the law. This expertise will continue to inform updates to the style guide, in recognition that language usage in the field of responsible AI is constantly evolving.
