# Uses of AI—terms for categories of AI use

A single AI system may have many uses. For example, a facial recognition system can be used to organize photos of people, manage access to secured spaces, or identify VIP shoppers at a retail store. However, the use—or misuse—of an AI system could infringe upon people’s human rights or could cause [fairness-related harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\f\fairness-related-harms.md), such as impacting people’s access to credit, education, or other services and benefits. It is important to use the following terms correctly when specifying or describing the context of an AI system’s development and deployment.
