# Unsupported uses

Potential uses of an AI system that are outside of the scope of an [intended use](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\intended-uses.md). Unsupported uses can include reasonably foreseeable uses for which the system was not designed or evaluated, as well as uses that Microsoft recommends customers avoid.
