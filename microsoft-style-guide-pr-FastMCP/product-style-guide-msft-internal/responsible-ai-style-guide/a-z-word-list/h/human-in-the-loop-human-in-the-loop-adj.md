# human in the loop, human-in-the-loop (adj.)

A machine learning practice of using human intelligence to create better models. Examples range from human annotators labeling data for informed datasets used in model training to people who work with model predictions (e.g., when a model is uncertain) giving direct feedback into the model for the purpose of retraining. (See *[human oversight,](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\human-oversight.md)* the use of human judgment for evaluating whether to accept model predictions and recommendations.)
