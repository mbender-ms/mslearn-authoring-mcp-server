# de-bias, debias

Do not use. Instead, use **identify, measure, and mitigate fairness-related harms.** Avoid using language that claims or implies “de-biasing” of AI systems or “guaranteeing” fairness. It is not possible to fully “de-bias” AI systems, which are composed of various [sociotechnical](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\sociotechnical.md) components, including people on development teams, training data, and user interfaces; these systems are **not neutral** by nature.
