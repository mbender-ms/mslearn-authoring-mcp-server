# sociotechnical

An approach to solving problems that cannot be addressed by purely technical solutions, requiring consideration of societal perspectives and social science theory.  

AI systems are *sociotechnical* in nature because they reflect the assumptions, priorities, and values of the people involved in the systems' development and deployment. Development teams make many decisions, such as which features and what types of algorithms to use as well as the environments the AI systems will be used in, with each decision embedding people's subjectivities and unintentional biases in the AI system. Machine learning (ML) models can also reflect societal biases and undesirable content that is present in the training data, and can therefore behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. An AI system, in addition to its ML models, has other *sociotechnical* components, such as a user interface.
