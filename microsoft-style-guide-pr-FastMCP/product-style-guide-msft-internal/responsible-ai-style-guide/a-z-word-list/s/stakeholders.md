# stakeholder(s)

People who are responsible for, will use, or will be affected by an AI system. An AI system can have many stakeholders—direct and indirect.

**Direct stakeholders** include people who will interact with an AI system directly and may create, own, use, and maintain the system. **Indirect stakeholders** include those who will not interact with a system directly but may be affected by an AI system’s downstream effects, such as bystanders, or individuals and communities that may be harmed by the short- or long-term use of the system. (Other types of indirect stakeholders include regulators and civil society organizations; and associated parties—those who have substantial interest in the system based on their relationship to other stakeholders [e.g., parent and child relationships].)
