# foundation model

A term that refers to a large-scale model that is trained on a vast amount of unlabeled data and that can be adapted with minimal fine-tuning for different tasks. Examples of foundation models include large language models such as GPT-3 and text-to-image models like DALL-E. (Note, the term *foundation model* originated in this [paper from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf).)
