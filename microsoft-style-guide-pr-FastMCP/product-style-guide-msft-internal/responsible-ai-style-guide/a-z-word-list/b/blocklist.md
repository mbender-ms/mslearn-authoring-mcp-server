# blocklist

A [harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\harms.md) mitigation technique that specifies system inputs and outputs that are not acceptable (e.g., a content moderation system may use a list of human-selected words to flag or block problematic comments). Use *blocklist* instead of *blacklist*. Note, blocklists also have the potential to introduce harms, such as [erasure](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\e\erasure-erasing.md).
