# bias

Do not use on its own; the term is often used as a catchphrase for fairness issues, [fairness-related harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\f\fairness-related-harms.md) and their causes, and more. Always qualify the specific context (e.g., *societal bias, statistical bias, cognitive bias, confirmation bias*).
