# overreliance

Overreliance on AI is the phenomenon of people using AI systems accepting incorrect AI outputs (i.e., making errors of commission). Overreliance generally happens when system users are unable to determine whether or how much they should trust the AI. Users have difficulty determining appropriate levels of trust because of lack of awareness about what the AI system can do, how well the system can perform, and how the system works.
