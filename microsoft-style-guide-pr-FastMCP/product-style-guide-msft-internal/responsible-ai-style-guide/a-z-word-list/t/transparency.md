# transparency

One of [the six Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/our-approach?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5), which states AI systems should be understandable. Transparency requires communicationâ€”those who build and use AI systems should be forthcoming about when, why, and how they choose to build and deploy them, as well as their systems' limitations. Another facet of transparency is intelligibility, meaning people should be able to understand, monitor, and respond to the technical behavior of AI systems.
