# train, training

A term that refers to providing a machine learning model's algorithm with a given [dataset](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\d\dataset.md) for processing and identifying patterns that the model will then use for performing predictive tasks in its deployment setting. (See [*learning*](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\l\learn-learning.md), [*dataset*](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\d\dataset.md).)

Note, **communicate clearly about the composition of training datasets because their composition impacts what we can say about what the model can and cannot do.** (See [*dataset*](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\d\dataset.md).)
