# restricted uses

By law or Microsoft policy, some AI systems are subject to additional restrictions on their development or deployment because they pose heightened risks to people and society that cannot be mitigated adequately. *Restricted uses* may arise in a range of circumstances, including where Microsoft determines that the use of an AI system is premature because inadequate guardrails exist to sufficiently mitigate heightened risks, or where an AI system cannot address the requirements of the use case at all or without heightened risk that cannot be mitigated adequately. See the Office of Responsible AIâ€™s [guidelines for more about restricted uses](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/ResponsibleAI/SitePages/Restricted-Uses.aspx).

The Office of Responsible AI expects Microsoft employees to consult the [Restricted Uses](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/ResponsibleAI/SitePages/Restricted-Uses.aspx) list each time they work to develop or deploy an AI system.
