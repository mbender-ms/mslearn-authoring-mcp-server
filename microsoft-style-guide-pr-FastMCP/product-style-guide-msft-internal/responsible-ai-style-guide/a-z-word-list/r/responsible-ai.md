# responsible AI

Use instead of *ethics* or *ethical AI.* A [human-centered](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\human-centered-ai.md) approach, the goal of responsible AI is to create trustworthy AI systems that benefit people while mitigating harms and is achieved through research-driven best practices.  

- **Do not use the term *responsible AI* as an adjective.** For example, avoid using phrases like *responsible AI systems* or *responsible AI compliant* because these terms mistakenly imply there is a once-and-done checklist for ensuring an AI system is a responsible product or service. Instead, considerations for responsible AI are ongoing throughout the entire [AI development and deployment life cycle](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\a\ai-development-and-deployment-life-cycle.md) of a system.

- **Use lowercase r** for r*esponsible AI*, except when occurring in a proper noun, such as the *Responsible AI Toolbox* or the *Responsible AI Standard*.)
