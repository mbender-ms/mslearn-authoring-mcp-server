# race

Race is a social construct that is generally considered an outdated typological pseudoscientific taxonomy where humans are classified into a finite number of groups wherein all members of a group are more biologically similar and more closely related to each other than they are to people outside of the group. *Race* and *[ethnicity](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\e\ethnicity-ethnic-identity.md)* have overlapping meanings and are sometimes used interchangeably, including in the US Census.
