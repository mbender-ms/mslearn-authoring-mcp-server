# Impact Assessment

A [responsible AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\r\responsible-ai.md) process for exploring the impact of an AI system may have on people, organizations, and society. Potential benefits and harms are explored through a [stakeholder](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\stakeholders.md) analysis, analysis of fitness for purpose, and consideration of failure and misuse. In the [Responsible AI Impact Assessment,](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/ResponsibleAI/SitePages/Responsible-AI-Impact-Assessment.aspx) mitigations for potential harms are proposed.
