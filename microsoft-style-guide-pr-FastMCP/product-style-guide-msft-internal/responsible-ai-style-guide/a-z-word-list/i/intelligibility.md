# intelligibility

You may see the terms _intelligibility, [explainability](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\e\explainability.md)_, and _[interpretability](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\interpretability.md)_ used interchangeably. While there is a lack of consensus in the research literature about each term’s precise meaning, we recommend the following: 

**Use _intelligibility_ when meaning that people should be able to understand, monitor, and respond to the behavior of AI systems.** Intelligibility is a comprehensive term that accounts for the [sociotechnical](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\sociotechnical.md) requirements for transparency in AI systems, and may be impacted by model components; user interfaces; and documentation, such as [Transparency Notes](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\t\transparency-note.md). Intelligibility is fundamental to transparency in AI. (See more about [Intelligibility: Facilitating people’s understanding of AI system behavior](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\transparency\intelligibility.md). See also _[explainability](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\e\explainability.md)_ and _[interpretability](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\interpretability.md)_.)
