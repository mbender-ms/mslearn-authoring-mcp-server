# artificial general intelligence (AGI)

In general, avoid using this term because it adds to confusion about the capabilities and limitations of AI systems. ([See Top Tip: Set expectations that failures are inherent in AI systems—they *will* fail](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\set-expectations-that-failures-are-inherent-in-ai-systemsthey-will-happen.md).)

Loosely, AGI refers to the aspiration of some AI research, where the goal is for autonomous AI systems to ”possess intelligence comparable to that of humans” ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547.pdf)). However, AGI is an ambiguous term ([source](https://sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/jagi/5/1/article-p1.pdf)), given there are different understandings as to what constitutes intelligence ([for example, as presented here](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HvXLCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=+R.+J.+Sternberg,+editor.+Handbook+of+Intelligence.+Cambridge+University+Press,+2000.&ots=F7AhRXlhDS&sig=xsxdMKeDZq5PGqU8xY6_C_GgdV0#v=onepage&q=R.%20J.%20Sternberg%2C%20editor.%20Handbook%20of%20Intelligence.%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%2C%202000.&f=false)), as well as there being a wide array of approaches proposed for developing AGI ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duch-Wlodzislaw/publication/200051288_Cognitive_architectures_Where_do_we_go_from_here/links/00b4951e97aa474d4b000000/Cognitive-architectures-Where-do-we-go-from-here.pdf)), such as computational neuroscience attempting to [digitally simulate the human brain](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/ten-years-human-brain-project-simulation-markram-ted-talk/594493/) or [developmental robotics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09540090310001655110?needAccess=true&role=button) acquiring intelligence through interaction with their physical environments, the way children develop.
