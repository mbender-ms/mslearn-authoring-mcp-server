# AI development and deployment life cycle

Use instead of *ML pipeline,* which is a term limited to workflows within machine-learning tasks and that does not encompass the sociotechnical aspects of AI systems (e.g., see [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines?msclkid=b9903046cd8d11ec8bf39e55133fdb1e).). See [Appendix 1 for diagram of the life cycle](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\appendix\appendix-1-the-ai-development-and-deployment-life-cycle.md).
