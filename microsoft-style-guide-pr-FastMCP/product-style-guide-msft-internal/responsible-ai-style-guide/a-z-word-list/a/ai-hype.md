# AI hype

A term that refers to making overclaims about AI and misrepresenting what it can do. See these [Top tips for talking about AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\top-tips-for-talking-about-ai.md):

- [Don’t overclaim or misrepresent what AI can do.](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-overclaim-or-misrepresent-what-ai-can-do.md)
- [Set expectations that failures are inherent in AI systems—they *will* fail](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\set-expectations-that-failures-are-inherent-in-ai-systemsthey-will-happen.md).

## Avoid AI hype.

Do not use hyperbole— for example, do not use terms like *magic*—when describing AI systems or their processes, outputs, or user experience. Empowering stakeholders to develop appropriate levels of trust in AI is a goal of responsible AI ([source](https://www.microsoft.com/research/uploads/prod/2022/06/Aether-Overreliance-on-AI-Review-Final-6.21.22.pdf)); hyperbole can lead to inappropriate levels of trust and [overreliance](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\o\overreliance.md) on AI.
