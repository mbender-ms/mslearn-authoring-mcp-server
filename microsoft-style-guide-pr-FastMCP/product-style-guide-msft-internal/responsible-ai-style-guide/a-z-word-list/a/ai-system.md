# AI system

An engineered system with [sociotechnical](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\sociotechnical.md) components (e.g., a user interface, data about people and the real world), designed for a given set of human-defined objectives to make predictions or recommendations. Such a system may operate with varying levels of automation. (Note, predictions can refer to various kinds of data analysis or production, such as translating text, creating synthetic images, or diagnosing a previous power failure.)
