# artificial intelligence (AI)

Defined as “the ability of a computer or other machine to perform those activities [tasks] that are normally thought to require intelligence” ([source](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=artificial+intelligence)), AI tasks involve various data analyses or production such as providing predictions or recommendations, language translation, computer vision systems, or speech recognition. AI is a human endeavor that combines information about people and the physical world into mathematical constructs. Such technologies typically rely on statistical methods, with the possibility for errors throughout an AI system’s lifespan.
