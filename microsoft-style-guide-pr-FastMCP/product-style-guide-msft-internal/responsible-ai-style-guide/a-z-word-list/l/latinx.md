# Latinx

Be aware that the term *Latinx,* a gender- and language-inclusive term for referring to people of Latin American ancestry—and which some Microsoft style guides recommend—may not be used or preferred by all people of Latin American ancestry. The term *Latin American* is an inclusive term that can be used instead. See [Latin ancestry](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\latin-ancestry.md).
