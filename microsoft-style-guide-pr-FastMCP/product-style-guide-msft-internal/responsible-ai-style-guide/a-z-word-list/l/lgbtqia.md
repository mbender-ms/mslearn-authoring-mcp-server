# LGBTQIA+

Refers to communities of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and all other underrepresented gender identities or expressions and sexual orientation. Microsoft uses the terms *LGBTQIA+ community* or *LGBTQIA+ people* globally. Note, the phrase *gay and transgender* is not an acceptable reference to this community because it excludes bisexual people, among others.
