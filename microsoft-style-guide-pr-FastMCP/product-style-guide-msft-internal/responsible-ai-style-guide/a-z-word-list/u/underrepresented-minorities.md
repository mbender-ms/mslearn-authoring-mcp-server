# underrepresented minorities

**Do not use.** The term *underrepresented minority* connotes racist and non-inclusive language ([more detail](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/245710-underrepresented-minority-considered-harmful-racist-language/fulltext)). **When discussing racial and ethnic minority groups, use the specific names groups give themselves.** Note, underrepresentation is not a fixed part of a groupâ€™s identity. (See [Demographics language: How to talk about groups of people](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\demographics-language-how-to-talk-about-groups-of-people.md).)
