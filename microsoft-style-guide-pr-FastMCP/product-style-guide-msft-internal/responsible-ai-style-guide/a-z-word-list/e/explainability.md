# explainability

You may see the terms _explainability, [intelligibility](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\intelligibility.md),_ and _[interpretability](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\interpretability.md)_ used interchangeably. While there is a lack of consensus in the research literature about each termâ€™s precise meaning, we recommend the following:

**Use the comprehensive term _[intelligibility](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\intelligibility.md)_ for clarity and consistency in communication and marketing content, especially when emphasizing human understanding.** However, it is acceptable to use _explainability_ when specifically referring to explanations of model or AI system behavior, such as algorithmically generated explanations that may be communicated in user interfaces. _Explainability_ can be a way to achieve intelligibility by enabling visibility into model or system behavior. Explainability is often used with complex black-box models that have low inherent _interpretability_. (See [Intelligibility: Describing transparency in ML models and AI systems](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\transparency\intelligibility.md).)
