# gender

Gender is an expression of social identity, and may refer to a person’s identity as *man* or *woman*; a blend of both; or neither. *Gender* and *sex* (an anatomical classification assigned at birth of *male, female,* or *intersex*) do not share the same meaning and should not be used interchangeably. In AI fairness work, the focus is often on *gender,* such as evaluating a model’s performance for gender fairness when allocating loans to men and women.
