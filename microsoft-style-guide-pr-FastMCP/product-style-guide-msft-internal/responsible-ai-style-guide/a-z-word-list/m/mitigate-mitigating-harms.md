# mitigate, mitigating harms

Use instead of *de-bias.* Emphasize that teams tasked with developing and deploying responsible AI systems work to **identify, measure, and mitigate fairness-related harms** as much as possible. [More about mitigating fairness-related harms.](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\related-harms\talking-about-mitigating-fairness-related-harms.md) (Note, the phrase *identify, measure, and mitigate harms* applies to the practice of each of the [six Microsoft AI principles](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\a\ai-principles.md).)Â
