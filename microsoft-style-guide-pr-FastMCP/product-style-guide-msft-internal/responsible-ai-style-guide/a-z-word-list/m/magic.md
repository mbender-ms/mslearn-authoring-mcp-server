Do not use this hyperbole when describing AI systems or their processes, outputs, or user experience. Avoid [AI hype](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\a\ai-hype.md), which does not empower stakeholders to develop appropriate levels of trust in AI. See these [Top tips for talking about AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\top-tips-for-talking-about-ai.md):
