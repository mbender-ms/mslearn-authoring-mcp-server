**How we talk about artificial intelligence (AI) matters.** Using language responsibly when talking about AI is important for not adding to confusion and misunderstandings about AI systems. Misunderstandings can result in over-estimating or misrepresenting what AI can do, as well as lead to either fear of or inappropriate reliance on AI and introduce [harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\harms.md) to people and society. Additionally, regulatory bodies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) make clear they are watching what companies claim AI systems can and cannot do, warning, [“Hold yourself accountable—or be ready for the FTC to do it for you.”](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai) (More about [Transparency in AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\transparency\transparency-in-ai.md))
