# Communicate that fairness in AI is fundamentally a sociotechnical challenge

Prioritizing fairness in AI systems requires both social and technical efforts. This means approaching problems with the understanding that purely technical solutions cannot address fairness and that societal perspectives and social science theory must be considered.

Because AI systems are composed of various [sociotechnical](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\sociotechnical.md) components, including people on development teams, training data, and user interfaces, these systems are **not neutral** by nature. Development teams make many decisions, such as which features and what types of algorithms to use as well as the environments the AI systems will be used in, with each decision embedding peopleâ€™s subjectivities and unintentional biases in the AI system.
