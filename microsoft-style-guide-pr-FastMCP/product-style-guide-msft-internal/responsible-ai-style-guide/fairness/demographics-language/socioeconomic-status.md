# Socioeconomic status

Socioeconomic status encompasses not only income but also educational attainment, occupational prestige, and subjective perceptions of social status and social class. Quality of life attributes and opportunities afforded to people within society are also a part of socioeconomic status, which is a consistent predictor of a vast array of psychological outcomes.

Socioeconomic status is complex. Communicating these complexities requires language that is both precise and sensitive, avoiding propagation of societal biases. (For a discussion, see [Diemer et al., 2013](https://faculty.coe.uh.edu/arbona/courses/PHLS%208334/Readings/Diemer_et_al-2013-Analyses_of_Social_Issues_and_Public_Policy.pdf)).

**Use the following guidance for talking about economic, education, residential, and legal status:**

## Education status

When talking about people's education level, use language that expresses a strength-based perspective. For example:

|--------------|--------------|
| people who have a grade-school education | high-school dropouts, people with less than a high-school education, poorly educated |

| **Use this** | **Not this** |
|--------------|--------------|
| people experiencing homelessness, people in emergency shelter, people in transitional housing | the homeless |
