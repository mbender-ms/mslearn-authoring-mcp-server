# Disabilities

People with disabilities have a mismatch in interaction between features of their body and the features of the environment in which they live. Most people will experience some form of disability during their lifetime.  

**Avoid ableist language, which devalues and dehumanizes people,** when communicating about people with disabilities.  

Use person-first language (e.g., *people with Alzheimer’s disease*), in general. However, be aware that some individuals or communities may prefer and request identity-first language (e.g., *autistic people, blind person*) to emphasize how disability is an integral part of their identity.  

Use accurate terms for specific conditions (e.g., *Alzheimer's disease* instead of *dementia*) when referring to a disability.  

**For detailed guidance** on talking about disabilities, see the [Microsoft Disability Language and Etiquette Guide](https://aka.ms/disabilityetiquette).
