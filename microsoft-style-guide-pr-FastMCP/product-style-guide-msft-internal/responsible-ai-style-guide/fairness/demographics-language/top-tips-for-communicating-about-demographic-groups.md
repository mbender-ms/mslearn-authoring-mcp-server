# Top tips for communicating about demographic groups

**Be specific when referring to demographic groups.**  
When discussing demographic characteristics in the context of fairness-related harms in AI, use the [specific and appropriate terms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\demographics-quick-reference.md) for groups of people. 

**Don’t mention demographic characteristics gratuitously.**  
Consider carefully whether characteristics such as race, skin color, gender, socioeconomic status, or others are relevant attributes to include in your communication. Ensure any discussion of demographic characteristics is contextualized within the framework of [fairness-related harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\related-harms\fairness-related-harms.md).

**Don’t assume demographic groups or characteristics are categorized the same worldwide.**  
Concepts like race or the nature of marginalized groups vary by country. Identify and use locally appropriate terms for demographic groups.

**Don’t use the possessive* *our* *when referring to specific communities:**
