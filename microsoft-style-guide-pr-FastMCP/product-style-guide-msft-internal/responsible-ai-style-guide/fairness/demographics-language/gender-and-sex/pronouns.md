# Pronouns

Always use a personâ€™s self-identified pronouns, including when a person uses *they* in the singular as their pronoun.

Always refer to someone's pronouns as *their* pronouns or *your* pronouns.

Do not use the phrase, *preferred pronouns.*

If you do not know the pronouns of the person being described, reword the sentence to avoid a pronoun or use the pronoun they. Using they, their, and them is inclusive of all people and helps writers avoid making assumptions about gender.

**Note:** There are alternatives in use to they, such as *ze, xe, hir, per, ve, ey,* and *hen* (which is a Swedish gender-neutral pronoun).
