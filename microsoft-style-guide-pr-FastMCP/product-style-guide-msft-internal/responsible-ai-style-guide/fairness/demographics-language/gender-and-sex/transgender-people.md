# Transgender people

*Transgender* is used as an adjective to refer to persons whose gender identity, expression, and/or role does not conform to what is culturally associated with their sex assigned at birth. Some transgender people hold a binary gender, such as man or woman, but others have a gender outside of this binary, such as gender-fluid or nonbinary. Individuals whose gender varies from presumptions based on their sex assigned at birth may use terms other than transgender to describe their gender, including *gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, gender-nonbinary, gender-creative, agender,* or *two-spirit,* to name a few.

**Use *transgender* as an adjective only,** not as a noun.
