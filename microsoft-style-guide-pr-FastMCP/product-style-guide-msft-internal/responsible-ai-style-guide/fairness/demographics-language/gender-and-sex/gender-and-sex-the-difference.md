# Gender and sex: the difference

***Gender* and *sex* do not share the same meaning and should not be used interchangeably**. Gender is an expression of social identity, whereas sex is an anatomical classification assigned at birth.  

From a fairness perspective in many contexts where AI systems are deployed, *gender* is more relevant than *sex.* However, in some applications in medicine, biological characteristics associated with sex (e.g., whether a person has a uterus) may be relevant.
