# National identity

National identity is a personâ€™s sense of belonging to a state or nation and involves many often co-existing and overlapping social identities, including territorial, racial, religious, linguistic, and gender identities ([Ashmore, Jussim, & Wilder, 2001](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=I1EyjaVR-VQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Ashmore,+Jussim,+%26+Wilder,+2001&ots=hoiClZ2Ixf&sig=lzSx3R2sMmsnAlPLKwcuMutP8S4)).
