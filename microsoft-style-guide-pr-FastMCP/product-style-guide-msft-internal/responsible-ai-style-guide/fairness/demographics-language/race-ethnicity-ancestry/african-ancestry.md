# African ancestry

People of African descent have varied cultural backgrounds, family histories, and experiences. Afro-descendent people will be from various regions in the United States, Caribbean islands, Latin America, countries/regions in Africa, or elsewhere.  

**Do not use _African American_ as an umbrella term for all Black people within the United States who have African ancestry** because this obscures the wide variety of Afro-descendent people’s ethnicities and national origins. Instead, use people’s specific national origin (e.g., Nigerian, Kenyan, Jamaican, Bahamian) when applicable.  

**Do not use _black, blacks, Blacks, brown, colored, communities of color, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, [and] People of Color), Afro-American, negro, Negro._**  

**Note:** Some American people of African ancestry prefer the term _Black,_ while others may prefer _African American_ or _African,_ all of which are acceptable.  

Using the terms _Black and African American community_ or _the Black community_ is acceptable when referring to American people of African ancestry. For example, the phrase _language varieties spoken in some Black and African American communities_ is used when discussing data collection in the United States for speech recognition systems.  

**Be aware that _Black_ is not used exclusively by people with African ancestry;** for example, Indigenous Australians and Papuans often identify as Black.
