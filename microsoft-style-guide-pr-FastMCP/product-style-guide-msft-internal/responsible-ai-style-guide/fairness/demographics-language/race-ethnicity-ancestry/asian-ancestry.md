# Asian ancestry

When referring to people with Asian ancestry, it is preferable—as for all discussions of race and ethnicity—to be more specific, when possible, about regional and national origin. 

The terms *South Asian, Central Asian, Southeast Asian*, and *East Asian,* defined below, may be used. However, stating national origin is preferable when possible.

**South Asia:** Includes most of India and countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

**Central Asia:** Includes Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan.

**Southeast Asia:** Includes the eastern parts of India and countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

**East Asia:** Includes states and territories such as China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and Taiwan.

**Note:** *Asian* and *Asian American* are not interchangeable terms. *Asian* refers to people of Asia, not US citizens. *Asian Americans* are Americans with Asian ancestry.
