# Ethnicity

Ethnicity is often described as a cultural identity involving [race](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\race.md), language, religion, and customs, which are based on an ethnic group's area or nation of origin, and which may be distinct from citizenship or country of legal nationality. 

<em>Ethnicity</em> and <em>race</em> have overlapping meanings and are sometimes used interchangeably. Attempts to distinguish between the two terms focus on ethnicity as a voluntary group membership and race as an involuntary grouping. In practice, however, <em>ethnicity</em> has replaced the usage of <em>race</em> in contexts where people wish to refer to some biologically salient categorization that implies a coherent group.
