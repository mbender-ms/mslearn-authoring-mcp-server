# Race, ethnicity, and ancestry

Acknowledging Microsoft’s recommendations for terms of race and ethnicity, this Responsible AI style guide provides additional guidance for talking about and working with complex societal data and fairness-related harms in AI systems.  

**Guidance for whether to choose terms of race, ethnicity, or ancestry** when talking about demographic groupings ([source](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:b:/t/Aether/EbY_fWA9fudPralF4NknAY4BmalMrExBuwkSfOb7M16zRQ?e=dBkz1a)):  

- To account for how a person is perceived with regard to social grouping, you may want to ask about how they are racialized (their [race](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\race.md)).  
- To account for how a person perceives themself, you may want to ask about what (ethnic) group they are a member of or how they would describe themself (their [ethnicity](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\ethnicity.md)).  
- To account for some unknown factor you believe may correlate with relatedness, you may want to talk about [ancestry](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\ancestry.md).  

**Note:** The [US Census format for race, ethnicity, and ancestry is very limited](https://hits.microsoft.com/Insight/1126388); it is not inclusive of important social groups and is not ideal for categorizing people’s racial and ethnic identities. However, with some exceptions for government reporting, Microsoft uses the following US Census terms to refer to communities within the United States:  

- Asian  
- Black and African American  
- Hispanic and Latinx  
- Native American  
- Alaska Native  
- Native Hawaiian  
- Pacific Islander  
- Indigenous Peoples  
- multiracial  
- white
