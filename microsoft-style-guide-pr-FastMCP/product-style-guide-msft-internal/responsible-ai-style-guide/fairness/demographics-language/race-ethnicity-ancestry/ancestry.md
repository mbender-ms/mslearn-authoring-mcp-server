# Ancestry

Ancestry is a term that can refer to genealogical or genetic ancestry. It is most often used with geographical terms (continental, regional, or national) but sometimes relates to cultural groups (e.g., Romani, Ashkenazi, Shoshone).

**Note:** When talking about or surveying ancestry of communities beyond the United States, see this [recommendation,](https://hits.microsoft.com/Recommendation/4082700) which indicates it may be more appropriate to refer to peopleâ€™s nation or country of ancestral origin for demographic categorization.
