# Middle Eastern and North African ancestry

When talking about people of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) ancestry, identify them —when possible and appropriate—by their specific nation of origin (e.g., Iranian, Iraqi, Egyptian, Lebanese, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, Tunisian).

**Note:** In some instances, American people of MENA descent who claim Arab ancestry may be referred to as _Arab Americans._ Do not use the term _Arabic_ to refer to a group of people; Arabic is a language.

| **Use this** | **Not this** |
|--------------|--------------|
| _Arab Americans_ may be acceptable when referring to American people of Middle Eastern and North African descent who claim Arab ancestry* <br/><br/> *Not all people of Middle Eastern and North African descent claim Arab ancestry. | Arabic |
| Name of people’s specific nation of origin (e.g., Iranian, Iraqi, Egyptian, Lebanese, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, Tunisian)* <br/><br/>  *[National origin] American, when referring to US citizens (e.g., _She is an Iraqi American._)  | Arabic |
