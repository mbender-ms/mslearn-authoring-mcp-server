# Indigenous ancestry

Indigenous Peoples (also termed _aboriginal people, native people,_ or _autochthonous people_) are distinctive groups who have linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory where they are its earliest settlers, before later development or occupation of a region by other groups. Some Indigenous groups may have specific rights protected in international or national legislation.  

**Refer to an Indigenous group as a _people_ or _nation._**  

**Do not use _tribe,_** unless specified by an Indigenous group.  

**Use the specific name** an Indigenous group prefers (e.g., _She is Huron-Wendat._).

The following are terms for only a few of the world’s many Indigenous communities:

- **Australia:** Indigenous Peoples may identify as _Aboriginal people, Aboriginal Australians, Torres Strait Islander People_ or _Torres Strait Island Australians._  
- **Canada:** Collectively, _Indigenous Peoples_ or _Aboriginal peoples_. Specify the group (First Nations People, Métis, Inuit) or nation, if possible.  
- **Latin America and the Caribbean:** Collectively, _Indigenous Peoples_ and by name, when possible (e.g., Quechua, Aymara, Taíno, Nahuatl).
- **New Zealand:** Indigenous Peoples may identify as _Māori_ or _the Māori people_ (the proper spelling includes the diacritical macron over the _a_).
- **United States:** _Native American_ or _Native North American_ (either of which may be preferred, by some, over the term _American Indian_).  
  - In Alaska, the Indigenous Peoples may identify as _Alaska Natives._  
  - In Hawaii, the Indigenous Peoples may identify as _Native American, Hawaiian Native, Indigenous People of the Hawaiian Islands,_ and _Pacific Islander._
