# Skin color

While [race](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\race.md) is a social construct, skin color is an observable property. **Race and skin color are not synonymous.**

Skin color can impact performance of AI systems, such as quality of service (e.g., in a facial recognition system). Skin color is often used inappropriately as a proxy for race, which leads to AI systems making incorrect correlations between skin color and race.

**Do not use the term** _**skin tone**_ in place of _skin color_. In various fields, words such as _tone, tint, hue,_ or _shade_ have specific meaning in the study of color. Color is the broadest term that captures everything from pigmentation (melanin) to other factors affecting the appearance of skin.

**Note:** Use language carefully when describing how processes like super-resolution may change the appearance of skin color when working to improve the performance of a facial recognition system. Avoid language that may infer prioritizing whiteness. For example, do not use terms such as “lighten” or “lightening” when referring to appearance of images of faces or skin color.
