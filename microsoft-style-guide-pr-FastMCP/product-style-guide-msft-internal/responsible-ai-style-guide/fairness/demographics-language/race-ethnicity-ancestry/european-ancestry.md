# European ancestry

When referring to people with European ancestry, it is preferable—as with all discussions of race and ethnicity—to be more specific, when possible, about regional origin (e.g., Southern European, Scandinavian) or national origin (e.g., Italian, Irish, Swedish, French, Polish).

The terms *white, European*, and *European American* are acceptable. 

**Do not capitalize white.**

**Do not use *Caucasian*.** While some style guides state *Caucasian* is acceptable, this style guide advises against its usage because the term originated as a way to classify people of European ancestry favorably when compared with other races.
