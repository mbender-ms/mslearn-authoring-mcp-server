# Race

Race is a social construct that has been mostly used to describe groups with similar phenotypic physical characteristics. In general, race is considered an outdated typological pseudoscientific taxonomy where humans are classified into a finite number of groups wherein all members of a group are more biologically similar and more closely related to each other than they are to people outside of the group. **Race and [skin color](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\skin-color.md)** are not synonymous. See [Ancestry](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\demographics-language\race-ethnicity-ancestry\ancestry.md) for language to describe peopleâ€™s racial, ethnic, and ancestral identities.
