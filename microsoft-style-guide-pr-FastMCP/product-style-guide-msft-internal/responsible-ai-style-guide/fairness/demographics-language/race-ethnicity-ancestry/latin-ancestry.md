# Latin ancestry

When talking about people with Latin ancestry, identify them—when possible and appropriate—by their specific nation of origin.

**Use _Latin American_** to describe only people with Latin ancestry from the geographic regions of North and South America.

**Be aware that usage of _Latinx,_ a gender- and language-inclusive term,** for people of Latin American ancestry—and which some Microsoft style guides recommend—may not be used or preferred by all people of Latin American ancestry. ([Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/11/about-one-in-four-u-s-hispanics-have-heard-of-latinx-but-just-3-use-it/))

**Do not use _Hispanic_ and _Latinx_ as interchangeable terms.** _Hispanic_ refers to an affiliation with the Spanish-speaking world (i.e., by colonization). This can include, for example, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, and Spain.  

**Use _Mexican_** to describe people from Mexico only.

**Use _Spanish_** to describe people from Spain only.

**Note:** The term _Latino_ and its related forms (e.g., _Latina, Latinx_) might be preferred by people originating from Latin America. Additionally, when talking about people who have identified their ancestry expressly as _Hispanic, Latino, Latina, Latinx, Latine,_ or _Latin,_ it is acceptable to use those terms of self-identification.
