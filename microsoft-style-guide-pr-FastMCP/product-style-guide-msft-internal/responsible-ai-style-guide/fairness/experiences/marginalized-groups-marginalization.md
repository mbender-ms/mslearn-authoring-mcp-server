# Marginalized groups, marginalization

*Marginalization* occurs due to unequal power relationships between social groups. *Marginalized groups* are those who are relegated to positions of little power or influence and are excluded from full participation within society.  

In fairness-related harms of an AI system, demographic groups that are marginalized may have an atypical or even unfair experience with the system because their needs and context were not considered in the development and deployment of the system. Marginalized groups **may** include [minorities](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\minority-groups-minorities.md) within a given population, stigmatized groups, or other [vulnerable groups](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\vulnerable-groups.md) (for example, children or older people; people with disabilities; or racial, ethnic, and religious minorities).

**Note:**

**Don’t assume minorities are marginalized.** When considering what groups may be marginalized in the context of an AI system, the intended uses and geographic deployment of the AI system must be taken into account.  

**Don’t use** *underprivileged* to describe individuals who belong to marginalized groups.
