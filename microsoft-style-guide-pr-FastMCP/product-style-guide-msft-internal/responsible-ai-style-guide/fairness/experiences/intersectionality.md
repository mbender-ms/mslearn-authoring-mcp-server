# Intersectionality

Intersectionality is a framework that recognizes identity markers such as race; class; gender identity or expression; sexual orientation; or religion, among others, which do not exist independently of each other. This framework conceptualizes the multiplier effect of bias, prejudice, disadvantages, and advantages experienced due to overlapping identities.  

Each individual has myriad identities, and those identities overlap and intersect in dynamic ways. The point of understanding intersectionality is to understand the variety of privileges or forms of oppression that one may experience simultaneously at any given time.  

**Failing to consider intersectionality can result in people with overlapping identities experiencing [fairness-related harms](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\related-harms\fairness-related-harms.md).** For example, some facial recognition systems have been found to have substantially higher error rates for darker-skinned women than for women overall and for darker-skinned people overall.
