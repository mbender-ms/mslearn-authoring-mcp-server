# Who experiences fairness-related harms?

An AI system [can have many stakeholders](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\s\stakeholders.md)—direct and indirect—who may be affected by the system. Indirect stakeholders can include individuals and communities who are affected by an AI system’s downstream effects, and who may be harmed by the short- or long-term use of the system.

It’s important to understand who is most likely to experience fairness-related harms in AI systems so that we use language that is properly descriptive and respectful when referring to these groups. 

When writing about human characteristics or when identifying groups of people within the context of fairness in AI, [be sensitive to intersectionality](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\intersectionality.md), which encompasses the overlapping cultural, structural, economic, and social contexts that shape people’s identities.  

The following are groups more likely to experience fairness-related harms in AI systems. Be sure to use these terms correctly:

- [Marginalized groups, marginalization](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\marginalized-groups-marginalization.md)
- [Minority groups, minorities](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\minority-groups-minorities.md)
- [Vulnerable groups](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\vulnerable-groups.md)
- [Underserved groups](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\underserved-groups.md)
- [Intersectionality](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\intersectionality.md)
