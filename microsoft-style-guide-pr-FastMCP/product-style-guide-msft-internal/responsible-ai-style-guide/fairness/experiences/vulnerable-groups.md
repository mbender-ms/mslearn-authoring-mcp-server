# Vulnerable groups

*Vulnerable groups* are populations that may be stigmatized, discriminated against, and marginalized by society. Vulnerabilities may include peopleâ€™s medical, economic, cognitive, social, or legal status.  

**Note:** Some vulnerable populations identified by US federal regulations include pregnant women and fetuses, minors, prisoners, persons with diminished mental capacity, and those who are educationally or economically disadvantaged. (See [underserved groups](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\fairness\experiences\underserved-groups.md) for additional insight.)
