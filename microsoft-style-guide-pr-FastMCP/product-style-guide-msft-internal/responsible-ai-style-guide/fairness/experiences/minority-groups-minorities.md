# Minority groups, minorities

A *minority group* is a population subgroup with ethnic, racial, social, religious, or other characteristics different from the majority of a given population.  

Always provide the context when referring to a minority group. A group may be a minority in a particular societal or geographic setting, but not in another. For example, women may be a minority group in a particular industry but are not a minority group within the overall population.  

**Note:** Although women are not a statistical minority, sometimes the phrase women and minorities is used to denote that women do not share the same power, privileges, rights, and opportunities as men.

**Don’t use the term minority to describe an individual.** For example, rather than saying, “Greg is a racial minority,” instead say, “Greg belongs to a racial or ethnic minority group in [name the societal or geographic setting].”

**Don’t assume members of minority groups are marginalized.**  

**Don’t use** ***underprivileged*** to describe individuals or minority groups.

**Don’t use the term** ***underrepresented minorities.*** Instead, use the specific name racial and ethnic minority groups give themselves. Underrepresentation is not a fixed part of a group’s identity. The term underrepresented minority connotes racist and non-inclusive language.
