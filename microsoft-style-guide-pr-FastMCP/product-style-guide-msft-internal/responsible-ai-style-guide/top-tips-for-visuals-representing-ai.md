# Top tips for visuals representing AI

**Ensure visuals don't misrepresent or humanize AI.** Communicating responsibly about AI encompasses appropriate choices of words *and images*. When selecting or developing visual content for AI-related projects, from logos to blogs:

- **Be aware of this CELA guidance:** ["Claims and visuals that appear in your advertising and marketing must be true, fair, and substantiated"](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-claims.aspx).
- **Use visuals that communicate in alignment with the Responsible AI Style Guide's [Top tips for talking about AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\top-tips-for-talking-about-ai.md)**, ensuring content that helps [set expectations](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\set-expectations-that-failures-are-inherent-in-ai-systemsthey-will-happen.md) and [doesn't overclaim or misrepresent what AI can do](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-overclaim-or-misrepresent-what-ai-can-do.md).
- **[Don't humanize AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-humanize-ai.md).** Do not use visuals that ascribe human traits or characteristics to AI. Avoid portraying AI with variations on themes of the human brain, allusions to Michelangelo\'s *Creation of Adam,* depictions of humanoid robots, and other anthropomorphic characterizations.

Be aware that anthropomorphizing AI contributes to misunderstandings about the technology\'s capabilities and limitations. Such misunderstandings can result in [overestimating or misrepresenting what AI can do](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-overclaim-or-misrepresent-what-ai-can-do.md), as well as lead to either fear of or [inappropriate reliance on AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\o\overreliance.md) and introduce [harm](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\harms.md) to people and society.

## Guiding questions for selecting visuals

When using visuals to communicate about AI, keep in mind that [responsible AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\r\responsible-ai.md) is a [human-centered](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\human-centered-ai.md) approach to AI, which focuses on ensuring that *what* we build benefits people and society, and that *how* we build it begins and ends with people in mind. Use the following guiding questions* to help keep your choice of images compatible with the Microsoft human-centered [AI principles](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\a\ai-principles.md):

- Is an image of an AI system necessary? Consider, instead, showing the deployment context of the AI system. For example, when representing an AI system deployed in medicine, images of people in medical settings can effectively communicate your message.
- Does the image show the AI system's [intended use](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\i\intended-uses.md)---the primary purposes for which customers, partners, or end users are expected to use it?
- Is the image [human-centered](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\h\human-centered-ai.md), showing that AI is created by and for people?

### Examples of dos and don'ts for visually representing AI

| **Use this** | **Not this** |
|----------|----------|
| Human-centered images that demonstrate:<br>- AI systems' context in [intended-use](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\uses-ai-terms\intended-uses.md) scenarios.<br>- AI is created by and for people.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>![Human centered-design](~/media/human_centered_use.png)<br>*Images from Microsoft 365 stock-image library and [Microsoft Brand Central AI Asset Collection](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/searchresults.html?search=AI&page=1&tab=Photography).* | Images that anthropomorphize AI and contribute to misunderstandings about the technology's capabilities and limitations.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>![Images that anthropomorphize AI](~/media/anthropomorph.png)<br>*Images from Microsoft 365 stock-image library and Creative Commons.*<br><br>[Don't humanize AI.](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-humanize-ai.md). Avoid portraying AI with themes of the human brain, references to Michelangelo's *Creation of Adam,* depictions of humanoid robots, and other anthropomorphic characterizations. |
| Abstract images to represent an AI system's components and processes.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>![Abstract images to represent AI](~/media/abstract_images.png)<br>*Images from Microsoft 365 stock-image library.* | Visual clichés, beyond the anthropomorphic, that contribute to [overestimating or misrepresenting what AI can do](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-overclaim-or-misrepresent-what-ai-can-do.md), as well as to either fear of or [inappropriate reliance on AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\o\overreliance.md).<br><br>Such tropes* include:<br>- Science fiction references (e.g., *The Terminator; 2001: A Space Odyssey; Minority Report*)<br>- Descending code (e.g., graphics of digital rain as in *The Matrix)<br>- White men in suits.<br>- Overuse of the color blue.<br>- White robots and cyborgs (see [Don't humanize AI](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\dont-humanize-ai.md)).<br><br>[*Source](https://blog.betterimagesofai.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Better-Images-of-AI-Guide-Feb-23.pdf) (Note, these tropes are also western-centric.)<br><br>**Examples:**<br>![Visual clichés](~/media/visual_cliches.png)<br>*Creative Commons images.* |
