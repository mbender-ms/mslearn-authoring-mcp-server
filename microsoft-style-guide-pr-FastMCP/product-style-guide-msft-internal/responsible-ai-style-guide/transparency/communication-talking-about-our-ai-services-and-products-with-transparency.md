# Communication: Talking about our AI services and products with transparency

Transparency, [a Microsoft AI principle](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\a\ai-principles.md), gives a competitive advantage when talking about our AI services and products. Using language that is easy to understand, does not overclaim or misrepresent, and is clear about the [intended uses](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\uses-ai-terms\intended-uses.md) as well as the capabilities and limitations of our AI systems builds credibility and earns trust with our customers and the general public.

Transparency in our marketing content and documentation is also fundamental to the Microsoft AI principles of [accountability](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\a-z-word-list\a\accountability.md) and fairness. Regulatory bodies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) make it clear that they are watching what companies claim their AI systems can and cannot do: [Hold yourself accountableâ€”or be ready for the FTC to do it for you](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai).

Use language responsibly to [set expectations](~\responsible-ai-style-guide\top-tips\set-expectations-that-failures-are-inherent-in-ai-systemsthey-will-happen.md) appropriately and help avoid serious consequences for companies and careers.
