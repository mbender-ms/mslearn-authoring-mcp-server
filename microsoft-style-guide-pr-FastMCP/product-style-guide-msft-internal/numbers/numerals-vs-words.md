# Numerals vs. words

In body text, use numerals for 10 and greater. Spell out zero through nine if the number doesn’t precede a unit of measure or if it’s not in a reference to user input. For round numbers of 1 million or more, you can use a numeral plus the word, even if the numeral is less than 10.  
**Exception:** If it’s necessary to save space in areas such as tables and the UI, you can use all numerals, even for zero through nine.

Use numerals for all measurements, even if the number is less than 10. This is true whether the measurement is spelled out, abbreviated, or replaced by a symbol. Measurements include percentage, currency, screen resolution, distance, dimensions, and so on, but generally not days, weeks, or other units of time. Bits and bytes are also considered units of measure.

Maintain consistency among categories of information. That is, if one number in a category requires a numeral, use numerals for all numbers in that category.
