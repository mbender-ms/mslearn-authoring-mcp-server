# Fractions and decimals

Express fractions in words or as decimals, whichever is most appropriate for the context.

In tables and other graphical formats, align decimals on the decimal point. For decimal fractions of less than one, insert a zero before the decimal point to aid readability. When you’re representing user input, however, don’t include a zero unless the customer is supposed to enter a zero.
