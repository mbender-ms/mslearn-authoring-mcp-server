# Ranges of numbers

In text, use *from* and *to* to describe a range of numbers. Where space is limited, such as in tables and forms, use an en dash (–) to indicate a range of numbers. Don’t use a space between the number and en dash in a range of numbers. And don’t mix the use of *from/to* and the en dash—use one method consistently.

**Our style**

**Not our style**  
from 9–17  
from 9 - 17
