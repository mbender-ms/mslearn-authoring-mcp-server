MAS contain a compilation of national and international standards and regulations that affect all components of software and hardware development, including web content. It also includes information about implementing and testing each standard. MAS include information about:

- Established accessibility guidelines and requirements
- Standards for accessible webpages
- Accessible writing
- Accessible graphics and design
- Acceptable terminology
