# Respect culture, ethnicity, gender, age, and class

There's a tremendous diversity in the people who use our products. Whether you’re designing products, crafting digital experiences and marketing communications, or developing product documentation, following these guidelines will help you make your message meaningful to all.

**Important:** In addition, there are several topics that are considered sensitive for a government audience. If you’re creating marketing content aimed at a government audience or put in a government context, run your proposed content through the [Government Content Review Process](https://aka.ms/GovReviewProcess). If you have questions about this process, contact [govtrev@microsoft.com](mailto://govtrev@microsoft.com).

- Keep politics, religion, sex, and violence out of your content. In particular, don’t use slang that’s sexually suggestive or derogatory of ethnicity, gender, or age. Even if you think the reference is funny or will be effective with your intended audience, these subjects are extremely sensitive. Offending your audience will undermine your message and harm the Microsoft brand.

- In examples, use a variety of male, female, and gender-neutral names, in addition to names that reflect a variety of cultures. Choose names that localize well. Also, don’t reinforce stereotypes about job roles. For example, don’t use male names exclusively for leadership and technical roles or female names exclusively for administrative roles.

- Don’t use the masculine pronoun (he, his, him, himself) or the feminine pronoun (she, hers, her, herself) to refer to an unknown or unnamed person. If it's appropriate for the context, use the second person (you)—that can also make your tone sound friendlier. If the second person (you) isn’t possible, reword the sentence to use a plural pronoun such as they or their, even if the subject is singular, like everyone.

- In examples and similar content, present diverse perspectives and circumstances. Remember that not everyone lives an affluent lifestyle. Things such as house or car ownership, access to higher education, leisure-time activities, and internet connectivity might not be the same for all. 

- Use references to holidays and historical events carefully—for example, Thanksgiving or the attack on Pearl Harbor. Different audiences may have strong negative reactions to some commemorative events. At the very least, cultural or religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter might have little or no meaning for many members of your audience.

- Avoid metaphors or use them with care. Baseball and US football metaphors might not be understood by readers worldwide. Religious, political, and war metaphors might be downright offensive to your reader. Research the origin of any metaphor you’re considering.

- Avoid pop culture references as they are often familiar only to a certain age range or generation and geography. 

- When introducing a list of countries, use the label _country/region_ or _country or region,_ not just _country._ Such lists may include the names of disputed territories, and using _country/region_ helps avoid offending some readers.

    **Our style**  
    In the Country/Region box, enter your location.
    
    **Not our style**  
    In the Country box, enter the name of your country.

- You don’t have to replace _country_ with _country/region_ in casual references. In the UX/Azure portal, it’s OK to use _region_ to refer to deployment locations.

    **Our style**  
    This Azure service isn’t available in all countries.
