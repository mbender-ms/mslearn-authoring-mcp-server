# Talking about the future

The ability to add future product and service features or capabilities is dependent on engineering time and prioritization. Teams should understand the risks of announcing or promising features if there aren't clear commitments from engineering to do so. If Microsoft puts out a public statement saying they will deliver something and then donâ€™t, customers can claim they were induced to purchase by that statement. It is important not to make false promises.

**Places to announce something new or upcoming**

If you are certain a new feature or capability is being released, the best avenues to share this with customers is in blog posts, Message Center posts, and public roadmaps.

**Places to avoid**

To mitigate risk, avoid publishing statements about future product plans in technical documentation or UI.

When you include messages about future features or capabilities in technical documentation or UI, it:

- **Isn't actionable.** Focus should be on what customers can and should do today, not what they might be able to do someday.
- **Can delay deployment.** Reading about valuable new functionality that's positioned as "coming soon" is a good reason for a customer to wait rather than deploy now.
- **Erodes trust.** If you say a feature is coming soon and it's delayed or canceled, the statement risks eroding trust for all our technical documentation or UI.
- **Looks like marketing.** Talking about the future looks more like marketing material (aspirational rather than reality).
