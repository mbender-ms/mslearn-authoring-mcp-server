# CELA legal quick reference

| Topic | Usage notes |
|-------|-------------|
| Accessibility messaging guidelines | It's important not to overstate or guarantee the accessibility of Microsoft technology, particularly in reference to compliance with laws, standards, or regulations.<br/><br/>  Follow these guidelines when referring to accessibility in customer-facing content: <br/>  - [Accessibility messaging guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/Accessibility-Messaging.aspx) |
| Claims and comparisons | Claims and comparisons can be an effective way of providing customers with useful information. However, you must take care that the claims you make don’t distort facts or misrepresent the truth. For complete information, see:<br/>  - [Making claims in advertising or marketing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-claims.aspx)<br/>  - [Comparative advertising guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/marketing-and-advertising-content-comparative.aspx) |
| Cloud services messaging | Naturally, cloud services messaging plays a large role in our customer communications, and content about cloud services must adhere to the same policies as all other marketing. In addition, content for cloud services has some unique issues to be aware of. See [CELA cloud messaging guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-cloud-messaging-guidelines.aspx). |
| Contests, prizes, and gifts | Contests must be approved by CELA and must adhere to the guidelines for planning and executing your contest. In addition, if you’re giving away a prize or gift in conjunction with a marketing promotion, there may be unique considerations to be aware of. For complete information, see:<br/>  - [Contests and promotions](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/promotions-contests.aspx)<br/>  - [Prizes and gifts](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb-marketing/sitepages/promotions-prizes-and-gifts.aspx) |
| Disclosures and disclaimers | It’s crucial to disclose important information to customers correctly, in a way that’s compliant with US regulations. To make sure you’re placing an adequate disclosure or disclaimer properly in your communications, refer to the [CELA guidelines for disclosures & disclaimers](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-disclaimers.aspx), and work with your business CELA and Ad Law contact. |
| Emails to customers | When emailing customers, include all required information. For guidelines, go to [Volume 2 of the Microsoft Privacy Standard](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/Privacy) and select **Implementation Rules: Email**. For additional information, see [Standard Consent Language and Standard Email Footers](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CPGCinfo/SitePages/Standard%20Opt-in%20and%20Opt-out%20Language.aspx). For an interactive, self-service questionnaire, see the [email checklist](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/checklists-email.aspx). |
| Fictitious/example content | If your content includes fictitious or example names, URLs, email addresses, and so on, be sure that your usage adheres to the [Approved fictitious names and guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-fictitious-names.aspx). These guidelines include company names that have been approved by CELA, plus a tool for generating acceptable personal names. |
| “Green” messaging | "Green" or environmental claims are getting a lot of government attention, so it's important that you have sufficient evidence on file to support any claims. Work with your Ad Law representative, and follow the [Green claims](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-green-claims.aspx) guidelines. |
| Linux | Special care is needed when writing about Linux in relation to Azure services. Microsoft doesn’t distribute Linux—rather, Microsoft enables the use of Linux with Azure—so it’s important not to suggest otherwise in your communications. In addition, content that discusses security, privacy, or compliance within a Linux context requires CELA review.  <br/><br/>This distinction is important because Linux's open-source license contains certain provisions that could undermine Microsoft patents if Microsoft is held to be distributing Linux software. Engineering has designed a solution where we never distribute Linux, and it's important that we not suggest otherwise in our public communications. <br/><br/> **Our style**<br/>  We enable/facilitate/support use of Linux on Azure. We make it easy for customers to use Linux/obtain Linux. We have engaged with Linux publishers who provide quick-start Linux solutions in Azure. We connect you with Linux publishers. <br/><br/> **Not our style** <br/> We provide/distribute/offer Linux. We make Linux available.  Get Linux from us. |
| Offers | If you’re writing about offers such as special pricing, a promotion, a rebate, a “bundle,” and so on, you must clearly and fairly communicate the details of the offer. Because offers can involve significant consumer protection and antitrust risks, all offers must be approved by CELA before they’re announced to the public. Contact CELA to get [clearance for your offer](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/marketing-and-advertising-content-offers.aspx). |
| Security and privacy | It’s extremely important to make sure your statements about security and privacy aren’t misleading and are appropriate for the intended audience. When you make any claim about security or privacy, refer to the [Security and privacy messaging checklist](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-security-privacy.aspx).  <br/><br/>Also, the [Microsoft Privacy Standard](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/lcamps) requires providing notice at the time of data collection about how we intend to use the personal information being collected. For more information, see [Consent requirements for contact preferences](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Compliance/SitePages/regulatory-compliance-privacy-and-security-contact-preferences-home.aspx). |
| Social media | It’s crucial to exercise good judgment when posting on blogs and social sites or otherwise engaging in social media. Important considerations include disclosing your Microsoft affiliation, discussing confidential or personal information, and talking about competitors. See:<br/>  - [General guidelines for engaging with social media](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb-marketing/sitepages/social-media-social-media-guidelines.aspx)<br/>  - [Reposting and retweeting guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/Reposting-and-Retweeting-Guidelines.aspx)<br/>  - [Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn promotions](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb-marketing/sitepages/promotions-facebook-twitter-pinterest.aspx) |
| Substantiation | Substantiation is defined as "true or competent evidence" or more simply, as "proof." Make sure you have your substantiation on file before you publish any claims.<br/>  - [Substantiation for advertising claims](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-substantiation.aspx) |
| System requirements | Customers should be able to trust that we’re accurate and truthful when telling them what they need to run Microsoft services. Before you finalize system requirements, review CELA's [System requirements guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/packaging-system-requirements.aspx). Be aware that you’ll need to send your proposed system requirements to your Ad Law rep for approval.  <br/><br/>In addition to the CELA guidelines, also refer to the [System requirements](/writing-style-guide-msft-internal/new-products/system-requirements) topic in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide*. |
| Testimonials, endorsements, and quotations | From a legal perspective, when you quote individuals or published sources in marketing, you’re essentially using another party’s copyrighted material. If you plan to publish endorsements or testimonials, follow the CELA [guidelines for using endorsements or testimonials](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-endorsements.aspx).  <br/><br/>If the endorsement you want to publish comes from an independent, third-party source and isn’t a paid endorsement, also see [Using quotes in advertising and marketing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-quotes.aspx). |
| Trademark requirements | Only a few types of communications require trademark attribution (that is, the use of trademark symbols or “bugs”). However, it’s still important to refer to Microsoft trademarks correctly in order to protect their status. For complete information, see:<br/>  - [Trademark list and attribution requirements](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-list-and-usage.aspx)<br/>  - [Branding and notices for advertising and marketing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-branding-and-notices.aspx)<br/>  - [A–Z names + terms](~\a_z_names_terms\az-names-and-terms.md) |
| Webpages | Before publishing material on a webpage, review your content with the interactive [Webpages, websites, & microsites self-service checklist](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/checklists-webpages-websites-microsites.aspx). |
