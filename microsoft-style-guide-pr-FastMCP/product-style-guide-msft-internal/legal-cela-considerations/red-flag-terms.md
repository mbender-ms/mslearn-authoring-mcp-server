# Red flag terms

Red flag terms are words, terms, or phrases that have special legal meaning or sensitivity. The table below introduces the red flag terms that you need to be aware of. For complete CELA guidelines for all the terms listed below, see [Red Flag Terms in Advertising and Marketing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-red-flag-terms.aspx).

| **Red flag term** | **Guidance** |
|-------------------|--------------|
| bundle, bundled with | Avoid these words, which are terms of art in antitrust law. Acceptable alternatives include comes with, is packaged with, is offered with, packaged set, or includes. If you’re planning to offer a bundle, [clear your offer with CELA](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/marketing-and-advertising-content-offers.aspx). |
| exclusive | The term exclusive can be an effective way to influence customers when describing a service that can be obtained only from Microsoft or its select partners. However, sometimes you’ll need to qualify the term in order to accurately describe the service or offer. Before describing your offer as exclusive, review the questions in [Red flag terms in advertising and marketing](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-red-flag-terms.aspx). |
| free | To be “free” legally, a product or service must be 100 percent free, with no associated costs or charges. In addition, many countries (including the United States), place a time limit on how long an offer may be advertised as free. If you want to advertise an item as free, you must have your free offer cleared with CELA. You must also contact your business CELA or Ad Law representative to obtain any required advertising disclosures. |
| integrate/interoperate | Use the words integrate and interoperate correctly: <br/><br/>-Integrate describes the relationship among features of a single Microsoft product or service. It refers to combining different features, programs, activities, or hardware into a single unit. <br/>-Interoperate describes the relationship between two separate Microsoft products or services. It refers to two or more separate units exchanging information, working together, or both. <br/><br/>In general, describing the relationship between a Microsoft product or service and a third-party product, add-in, or service isn’t as sensitive as describing the relationship between two or more Microsoft products or services. |
