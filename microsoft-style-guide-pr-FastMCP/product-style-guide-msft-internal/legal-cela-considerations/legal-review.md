- Press releases
- Messaging frameworks
- Any communications that refer to or include:
- Contests
- Disclosures or disclaimers
- “Green” messaging
- Special offers
- Security, privacy, or compliance in Linux environments
- New, previously unpublished system requirements

To find the appropriate CELA contact, see [CELA contacts for advertising, marketing, PR, packaging, & branding](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-lca-contacts-for-advertising-marketing-pr-packaging-branding.aspx).

Some types of communications typically don’t require review by CELA. Instead, these materials should follow the appropriate guidelines on the [CELA Marketing Self-service site](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/checklists.aspx). These materials include:

- Brochures and flyers
- Case studies
- Conference and trade show materials
- Direct mail
- Blogs
- Email
- Videos, demos, podcasts, and webcasts
- Websites, webpages, and other web content
- PowerPoint presentations
- Training
- White papers

The self-service tool may flag an issue in your materials that requires review by CELA. If the materials that you’re creating require review, send them to the appropriate [CELA contact](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-lca-contacts-for-advertising-marketing-pr-packaging-branding.aspx).
