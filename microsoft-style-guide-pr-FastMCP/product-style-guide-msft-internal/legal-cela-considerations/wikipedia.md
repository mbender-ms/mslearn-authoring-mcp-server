Here are guidelines for editing Wikipedia entries about Microsoft technologies. *We should propose edits sparingly and only to correct significant technical errors.*

**Guidelines**

- **Review Wikipedia’s conflict of interest statement. Use the article talk page to propose edits.** [From Wikipedia: Conflict of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest) You are discouraged from writing articles about yourself or organizations (including their campaigns, clients, products and services) in which you hold a vested interest. If you feel that there is material within an existing article which is incorrect or not neutral, **please point this out on the article's talk page.**

- **Use only accounts that identify you as a Microsoft FTE.** Example: Create a Name_MSFT account and tie it to your Name@microsoft.com

- **Sources:** Cite technically authoritative (and neutral where possible) internet sources for each change where possible, for example, Microsoft and popular technical third-party blogs.

- **Competition:** Never discuss the competition.

- **Why you request the edit:** Example: “My name is *Name,* and I am a program manager at Microsoft. I am submitting the following edits to address what I believe is a *technical inaccuracy | out-of-date observation.* Please review my edits and if you find them to be agreeable with Wikipedia’s rules, incorporate them. If not, let me know what I should change. My goal is to simply address issues that do not reflect the current technical nature of our product/feature.”

- **Response:** When you get a response, quickly address the issues. Don’t offer excuses or take it personally. The goal is to get the update made and show respect for the community. Continue to cite authoritative sources if your edit is not accepted initially. Eventually (assuming you don’t violate protocol), your edits are likely to be accepted and implemented by a Wikipedia editor and your professionalism will reflect well on Microsoft.
