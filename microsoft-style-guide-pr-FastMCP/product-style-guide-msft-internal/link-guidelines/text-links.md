# Text links

**Don’t put a link in the middle of a non-linked sentence.** It's best (for localization and accessibility) to have link text stand on its own.

**Example**: "You can use Insights to view student progress over time. Learn how to add the Insights tab to Teams."

**Make link text specific to the link destination.** Avoid “Learn more” and other general phrases as link text by itself. For better scannability, accessibility, and SEO in link text, make sure your link text describes what the user will get from that destination.

**Link only to Microsoft content, not third-party content**, unless specifically directed to do so by CELA or your writing lead. In most cases, links go to our own support, documentation, legal, or other Microsoft content.

**In product UI**, make sure that links to documentation do not imply direct action, by including words that clearly indicate that they are about learning or information, and do not imply direct action. **Learn how to, Learn more about**, and similar phrases are useful for introducing a link that targets a related Help article.

**Example**, say Learn more about customizing sign-in pages and not Customize sign-in pages (even if that is the name of the article you are linking to).
