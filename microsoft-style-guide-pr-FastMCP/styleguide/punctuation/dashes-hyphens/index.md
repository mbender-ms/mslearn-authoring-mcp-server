# Em dashes, en dashes, hyphens, and minus signs

Em dashes (—), en dashes (–), hyphens (-), and minus signs (&minus;) aren't interchangeable symbols. Follow these guidelines to help you use them the right way, in the right places.

- **Em dashes**: Use to signal a break in thought, or to set off some immediate clarification, amplification, or parenthetical remark that you want to add within a sentence. Em dashes can be an effective alternative to colons, semicolons, and parentheses, but don't overuse them. Like colons, semicolons, and parentheses, em dashes can affect readability if they are used excessively, by interrupting the flow of the text and making sentences overly long and complex. Don't use spaces around em dashes.
- **En dashes**: Use in ranges of numbers and dates, such as in time and date stamps in UI. An en dash can also be used instead of a hyphen in some compound words (see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md) for details). Don't use in place of the minus sign. Don't use spaces around en dashes.

    **Exception** Use spaces around an en dash when it's used in a time stamp appearing in UI, or in a date range that includes two times and two dates.

- [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md): Use to join words and connect prefixes to stem words. Don't use multiple hyphens in place of an em dash.
- **Minus signs**: Use to represent subtraction operations and negative numbers. For accessibility reasons, don't substitute an en dash for the minus sign.
