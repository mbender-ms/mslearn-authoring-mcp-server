# Punctuation checklist

Keep it simple.

- Stick to short, simple sentences. Sentences that contain lots of punctuation tend to be complex and hard to read.  

- End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words.  

- Use only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation marks, and colons.  

- Include a colon at the end of a phrase that directly introduces a list.
  - If one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every list element. 
  - If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don’t end them with periods, even if they form a complete sentence together with the list introduction.  
  - If one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element, even if a list element contains three or fewer words.

- Include commas after every item in a series, including the last one.  
  Example networks, storage, and virtual machines  

  You might know that extra comma as the Oxford comma. [Learn more](~/punctuation/commas.md).

- Use a comma following an introductory phrase, to join independent clauses with a conjunction, and to surround the year when you use a complete date within a sentence. [Learn more](~/punctuation/commas.md).

- Use an apostrophe to indicate a missing letter in a contraction (such as _don’t_) and to form the possessive case of a noun (as in _Insider’s Guide_). Don’t use an apostrophe for the possessive of _it_ (its) to avoid confusion with the contraction _it’s_. [Learn more](~/punctuation/apostrophes.md).

- When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless it's a proper noun or the first word of a quotation. [Learn more](~/punctuation/colons.md).

- A sentence that contains a semicolon might be complex. Try to rewrite the sentence as multiple sentences or break it into a list. [Learn more](~/punctuation/semicolons.md).

- Use exclamation points sparingly. Save them for when they count.  

- Use question marks sparingly. Customers expect _us_ to give _them_ answers. [Learn more](~/punctuation/question-marks.md).

- Place closing quotation marks:
  - Outside commas and periods.
  - Inside other punctuation.

  Exception If punctuation is part of the quoted material, place it inside the quotation marks.

- In general, don’t use hyphens unless leaving them out could result in confusion. [Learn more](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).

- Don’t use spaces around em dashes (—). [Learn more](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/index.md).

- Don’t use a slash (/) to indicate a choice or as a substitute for _or_. [Learn more](~/punctuation/slashes.md).

- In general, format punctuation in the same font style as the main content of a sentence or phrase unless it's part of an element such as a command, option, keyword, placeholder, link, pop-up text, or user input.
