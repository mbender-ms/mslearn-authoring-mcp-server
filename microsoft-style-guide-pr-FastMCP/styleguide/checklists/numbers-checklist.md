# Numbers checklist

When you write about numbers used in examples or UI, duplicate them exactly as they appear in the UI. In all other content, follow these guidelines. For detailed guidelines, see [Numbers](~/numbers.md).

## Spelled out numbers

Use for:

- Zero through nine, unless space is limited.
- One of the numbers, when two numbers that refer to separate categories must appear together. For example, *two 3-page articles*.
- At the beginning of a sentence.
- Ordinal numbers, such as *first.* Don't add *-ly*, as in *firstly*, to ordinal numbers.

## Numerals

Use for:

- Numbers in UI.
- Numbers 10 or greater.
- Numbers zero through nine when you have limited space.
- All numbers in a category if one or more numbers requires a numeral. For example, *a 16-page article, a 7-page article, and a 3-page article.*
- Measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size, weight, pixels, points, and so on. To learn more, see [Units of measure term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/units-of-measure-terms.md).
- A round number of 1 million or more.
- Numbers the customer is directed to type.
- Dimensions. Use the multiplication sign (×), preceded and followed by a space, for tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes. For everything else, spell out *by*.
- Time of day.
- Percentages. Use the percent sign (“%”) with numerals, rather than spelling out “percent.” 
- Coordinates of tables or worksheets and numbered sections of documents.

## Commas

- Use in numbers that have four or more digits, regardless of how they appear in the UI.
  Exception: When designating years or baud, use commas only when the number has five or more digits.
- Don't use in page numbers, street addresses, or decimal fractions.

## Dates

- Don't use ordinal numbers, such as *June first* or *October twenty-eighth*, for dates. Use a numeral instead.
- Always spell out the name of the month.

Learn more about [dates and time](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/date-time-terms.md).

## Negative numbers

- Form a negative number with a minus sign, not an en dash. Learn more about [Em dashes, en dashes, hyphens, and minus signs](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/index.md).

## Compound numbers

- Hyphenate compound numbers when they're spelled out. Learn more about [Em dashes, en dashes, hyphens, and minus signs](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/index.md).

## Fractions and decimals

- Don't use numerals separated by a slash to express fractions.
  Exception: When an equation occurs in text, it's OK to use a slash between the numerator and the denominator.
- Hyphenate spelled-out fractions. Connect the numerator and denominator with a hyphen unless either already contains a hyphen (for example, *one-third* but *three sixty-fourths*). Learn more about [Em dashes, en dashes, hyphens, and minus signs](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/index.md).
- In tables, align decimals on the decimal point.
- In decimal fractions less than one, include a zero (*0.1255*, for example) unless the customer is asked to type the value.
- When spelling out units of measure, use the singular form for quantities of one or less, except for zero, which takes the plural form. Learn more about [units of measure](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/units-of-measure-terms.md).

## Ranges of numbers

- In most cases, use *from* and *through* to describe a range of numbers.
  Exception: Use an en dash in a range of pages or where space is an issue, such as in tables and UI.
- Don't use *from* before a range indicated by an en dash, such as *10–15*.

Learn more about [Em dashes, en dashes, hyphens, and minus signs](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/index.md).

## Abbreviations

- In UI, avoid *K, M,* and *B* as abbreviations for *thousand, million,* and *billion* unless space is limited.
- In other content, spell out *thousand, million,* and *billion,* or use the entire number.
- Contact your localization team before using these abbreviations in content that will be localized.
- If you must use the abbreviations, follow these guidelines:
  - Capitalize *K, M,* and *B.*
  - Don't put a space between the number and the abbreviation.
  - Use the decimal form of a number (such as *8.25M*) only if it really will save space.
