# Capitalization checklist

In general, Microsoft style is sentence-style capitalization.

- Always capitalize proper nouns.
- Lowercase everything except the first word in a sentence, UI label, phrase, heading, or title (including the titles of blogs, articles, and press releases).
- Donâ€™t capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.
- Use title-style capitalization for product and service names, book and song titles, article titles in citations, names of blogs, and titles of people (_Vice President_, for example).
- It's OK to use title-style capitalization in tweets to set off a quoted article.
- In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.
- Don't use all uppercase for emphasis.
- Don't use all lowercase as a design choice.
