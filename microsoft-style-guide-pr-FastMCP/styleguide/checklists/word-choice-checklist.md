# Word choice checklist

Choose simple, precise words that you use in conversations.

- Use common contractions, such as _that's_ and _don’t_. They’re friendly and conversational. [Learn more](~/word-choice/use-contractions.md).

- Avoid words with more than one meaning. [Learn more](~/word-choice/use-simple-words-concise-sentences.md).

- Use as few words as possible. Omit unnecessary adverbs (words that describe how, when, or where) and use precise, one-word verbs (such as _try_ instead of _attempt to_) whenever you can. [Learn more](~/word-choice/use-simple-words-concise-sentences.md).

- If you mean the same thing, use the same word. Use the **A–Z word list** and your group's editorial style guide to find preferred terms for Microsoft content.

- Don’t give technical meanings to common words (like using _bucket_ to mean _group_) or use nouns as verbs or verbs as nouns. [Learn more](~/word-choice/dont-use-common-words-in-new-ways.md).

- Don’t create a new word if one already exists. If you’re working on emerging technology, research terminology already in use before you create a new term. [Learn more](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md).

- Use technical terms carefully and define them in context if there’s a chance your audience won’t understand them. Use plain language whenever you can. [Learn more](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md).

- Use the words your audience uses. If you're writing for a particular industry, such as healthcare or construction, refer to reputable language sources (industry glossaries or associations, for example) to make sure you’re using industry terms correctly. [Learn more](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md).

- Avoid jargon when there’s a familiar word that will do. [Learn more](~/word-choice/avoid-jargon.md).

- Don't use words that attribute human characteristics to devices and products. Devices don't think, feel, or otherwise exhibit human characteristics.
