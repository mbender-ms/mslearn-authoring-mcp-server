# Acronyms checklist

Although some acronyms are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term, others aren’t well known or are familiar only to a specific group of customers. These tips will help you use acronyms and abbreviations in a way that’s clear and meaningful.  

- Always spell out Microsoft product and feature names.
- Only use acronyms that your audience is familiar with.  
- For most acronyms, spell out the term first and include the acronym in parentheses. On subsequent mentions, you can use the acronym without spelling it out.  
- Lowercase all words in the spelled-out form of an acronym except for proper nouns.
- Don’t spell out the acronym if it’s listed in *[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)* or if the **A–Z word list** says to use the acronym without spelling it out. If you’re sure your audience is familiar with an acronym, it’s OK to use it without spelling it out.  
- Don’t introduce an acronym that’s used just once unless it’s needed for SEO.  
- Avoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading, unless it’s a keyword that you need to place in the title or heading for SEO.  
- Use *a* or *an,* depending on how you pronounce the acronym (for example, *an ISP, a SQL database*).  
- Form the plural of an acronym like you would any other noun (for example, *three APIs*).  
- Unless an acronym refers to a person or an organization, avoid using the possessive form.  
- In content that will be machine translated, be careful with acronyms that form common English words, like *RAM.* They can be translated incorrectly.
