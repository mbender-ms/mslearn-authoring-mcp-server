Follow [Microsoft brand illustration guidelines](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/asset-detail.html?id=L2NvbnRlbnQvZGFtL3NvdXJjZS9taWNyb3NvZnQtYnJhbmQvYnJhbmQtaWRlbnRpdHkvaWxsdXN0cmF0aW9uL21pY3Jvc29mdF9pbGx1c3RyYXRpb25fZ3VpZGVsaW5lcw%3D%3D&bundleName=Microsoft+illustration+guidelines) if you’re using illustrations in your content.

**Tell an engaging story.** Illustration should have a purpose beyond decoration. Use it to communicate a clear message in a visually engaging way.

**Stylize with active geometry.** Microsoft illustration style utilizes geometric shapes that feel digital and align with our product user **experiences.** Illustration should be simple, but never static or sterile.

**Use vivid color.** Use energetic, flat colors drawn from the [Microsoft color palette](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/asset-detail.html?id=L2NvbnRlbnQvZGFtL3NvdXJjZS9taWNyb3NvZnQtYnJhbmQvZ3VpZGVsaW5lL21pY3Jvc29mdC1icmFuZC1leHRlbmRlZC1jb2xvci1wYWxldHRl&bundleName=Microsoft+brand+extended+color+palette).

**Use the Microsoft illustration library.** Avoid purchasing stock illustration whenever possible. [Find a Microsoft illustration](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/microsoft-brand/brand-identity/illustration.html). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

**Make sure you have legal permission** to use the illustrations in your content. To learn about legal guidelines for using images, see [Copyrights and trademarks](~/legal-content/copyrights-and-trademarks.md).

**Avoid using text in illustrations** that will be localized. If you must use text, put it on a separate layer from the graphics. To learn more about using images in global communications, see [Art](/style-guide/global-communications/art).

**If illustrations convey information** that’s important to the story, describe them clearly and completely in captions or alt text to support people with low vision. To learn more about accessible images, see [Graphics, design, and media](/style-guide/accessibility/graphics-design-media).
