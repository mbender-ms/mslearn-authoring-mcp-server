# Photos

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Microsoft photos are authentic, optimistic, and brave.

- **Authentic** You believe it and feel like you’re there.
- **Optimistic** We illuminate the joy and triumph of everyday life.
- **Brave** We aren’t afraid to stand out and be ourselves.

When you need photos to illustrate web content or marketing collateral, use the [Microsoft photo library](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/microsoft-brand/campaigns-and-content/assets-collections.html), an expansive set of shared lifestyle and product photography available for use in Microsoft communications. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) Avoid purchasing stock photography if you can.
