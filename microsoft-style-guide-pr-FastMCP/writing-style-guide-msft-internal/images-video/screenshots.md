# Screenshots

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Screenshots are useful for simplifying complex procedures or concepts. But use them sparingly. If they contain text, and most do, localizing them is expensive and time-consuming.

When you use screenshots, follow these guidelines.

- Show only the portion of the screen that's necessary to explain the concept or procedure.  
  *Example*  
  ![Example Image](~/media/250946014.png)
  
- Create text in the interface that reflects Microsoft voice and editorial style.

- Use approved fictitious names and scenarios. To learn more, see [Fictitious names, domains, and addresses](~/legal-content/fictitious-names-domains-and-addresses.md).

- Describe the image clearly and completely in captions or alt text to support people with low vision. To learn more about accessible images, see [Graphics, design, and media](/style-guide/accessibility/graphics-design-media).

- If the screenshot will be localized, give your localization team or vendor the files shown in the image, in addition to detailed instructions on how to re-create the screenshot.
