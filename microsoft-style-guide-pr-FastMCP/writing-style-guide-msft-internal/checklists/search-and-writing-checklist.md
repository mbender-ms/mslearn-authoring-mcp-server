# Search and writing checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Search-friendly writing can help customers find your content in search engines.

- Research keywords and use them in headings, subheadings, introductions, link text, alt text, and page descriptions. Use the following resources for your research:
  - [Bing Keyword Research tool](https://www.bing.com/toolbox/keywords/)
  - [Google Adwords Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.co.uk/KeywordPlanner?sourcedoc=%7b0C43A47E-BC20-44B3-A1E7-4FDC06EAF830%7d&file=Video%20Production%20Guide.docx&action=default)
  - [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)
- Link to related information, using the page title as the link text if you can or descriptive link text if you can't.
- Ask other sites to link to your page from closely related content.
