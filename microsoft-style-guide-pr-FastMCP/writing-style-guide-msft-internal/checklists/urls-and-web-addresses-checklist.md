# URLs and web addresses checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Follow these guidelines to refer to URLs and other addresses clearly and consistently. For detailed guidance, see [URLs and web addresses](/style-guide/urls-web-addresses).

- Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses.  
  **Exception**  
  To refer generally to a website or domain, such as Microsoft.com, capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently.

- Don't include *http://* or *https://* in a URL. Include other protocols, such as *ftp://*.

- Don't include a slash at the end of a URL.

- Use *web address,* not *URL,* for a general audience. For a technical audience, it's OK to use *URL,* but don't spell it out on the first mention.

- Write short, specific, and informative link text. In alt text for a graphical link, state that the graphic is a link.

- Use *of* (not *for*) to describe the relationship of the word *URL* to a resource.  
  **Example** the URL of the page

- Use the preposition *at* with the location of a specific address.  
  **Example** at [www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com)

- Use *a* as an article preceding *URL.*

- If punctuation follows a URL, make sure it's clear that the punctuation isn't part of the URL.
