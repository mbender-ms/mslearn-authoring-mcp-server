# Final publishing review checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Double-check your work. Every detail—from facts to proper usage and placement of punctuation marks—makes a difference. Clear, accurate content that’s free of spelling and grammar mistakes is easy to read and builds trust in Microsoft's commitment to quality.

- Always rewrite, edit, and proofread. Even better, have someone else check your work.
- Read it out aloud, backward and forward. Potential problems and edits will jump out.
- Read only the headings or the first sentence of every paragraph. Do they tell a story?
- Frontload keywords in titles and headings.
- Eliminate every repetitive or redundant element.
- Excise adverbs (words describing how, when, and where).
- Evaluate the personality—your writing should sound like a person, not a robot. Learn more about the [Microsoft voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human).
- Take things out. If you don’t miss them, leave them out.
- If you have to read anything twice, simplify it or take it out.
- Reread your original objectives. Did you meet them?
- Leave your copy alone for a day. Then give it a final read with a fresh perspective.
- Pay attention to [legal requirements](~/legal-content/legal-content.md) and [cite quotations and references](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-quotes.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
- Use a spelling and grammar checker. But check each recommendation before you accept it—only you know whether you mean *manager* or *manger*.
