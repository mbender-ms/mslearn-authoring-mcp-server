# Images and video checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Before using images in content, familiarize yourself with the guidelines for [bias-free communication](/style-guide/bias-free-communication); [accessible graphics, design, and media](/style-guide/accessibility/graphics-design-media); and [copyrights and trademarks](~/legal-content/copyrights-and-trademarks.md).

- If you include text in an image file, make sure it’s easy to edit the text, in case the content is localized. (Screenshots are an exception.)
- If text will overlay images, make sure the text won't obscure any important detail.
- Crop images to eliminate unnecessary detail.
- Make sure you have legal permission to use images. If you’re unsure, reach out to [your group’s paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
- Describe images using captions or alt text if they convey important information.

## Photos

Use photos that are authentic, optimistic, and brave. 

- Avoid purchasing photos—look in the [Microsoft photo library](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Search/pages/BCPhotographyResults.aspx) first. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
- When you must create or purchase photos, follow the [Microsoft brand guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Photography.aspx). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

## Illustrations

Use vividly colored illustrations, stylized with active geometry, that tell an engaging story. 

- If possible, use illustrations from the [Microsoft illustration library](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Search/Pages/BCIllustrationsResults.aspx?WT.mc_id=Feb18_NL_IllusSearchResults_2&k=Illustrations). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
- When you must create or purchase illustrations, follow the [Microsoft brand guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Illustration.aspx). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

Learn more about [illustrations](~/images-video/illustrations.md).

## Screenshots

Use screenshots sparingly to simplify complex procedures or concepts. 

- Follow the guidance for [fictitious names, domains, and addresses](~/legal-content/fictitious-names-domains-and-addresses.md). 
- Show only the portion of the screen that's necessary to explain the concept or procedure.
- Accompany each screenshot with a caption or other text that reflects Microsoft voice and editorial style. 
- Give your localization team or vendor the files and details they need to re-create the screenshot.

## Network traffic flows

Illustrate network traffic consistently.

- Provide a legend explaining the visual conventions used.
- Represent one-way communication with single-headed arrows and two-way communication with double-headed arrows.
- Use sentence-style capitalization, not all uppercase or title-style capitalization. To learn more, see [Capitalization](/style-guide/capitalization).
- Use fonts from the Segoe font family. To learn more, see [Use the Segoe font family](~/text-formatting/using-type/use-the-segoe-font-family.md).
- Use colors from the Microsoft brand palette. To support customers with low vision, use colors that contrast with the background and that are distinguishable in black and white. To learn more, see the [brand color guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Color.aspx). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
- Use line styles to distinguish traffic flows. 
- Label specific network traffic, preferably on the line or alternatively as a callout.
- Represent security boundaries with solid vertical lines. Show traffic crossing them when appropriate.
- Use standard syntax.

## Video

Video is an interesting and effective way to communicate complex topics. Up-front planning will help you keep your costs down and quality up. 

- Try for 90 seconds or shorter. Keep videos short unless they're webcasts or detailed technical content. 
- Plan the beginning, middle, and end with storyboards. 
- Tell a story. Focus on a few key points with no extraneous details.
- Decide what will be in your audio voice-over and what text will appear on the screen. 
- Write clear, benefit-driven titles and descriptions.
- Use sentence-style capitalization in all video content. It’s our style.
- Avoid dates, product versions, or anything else that will date the video. 
- When recording the voice-over, speak clearly at a moderate pace. If you’re demonstrating tasks, don’t explain every minor action—show more than you tell.
- Include full script captions for accessibility.
- Use brand elements for opening and closing frames properly.
