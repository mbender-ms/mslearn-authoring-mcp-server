# Security, safety, and privacy content checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Absolute security, privacy, and safety don't exist. When you write about these subjects, which are a big concern for many customers, be reassuring but realistic.

- Don’t make absolute statements about security, safety, or privacy. When you talk about these subjects, avoid absolute verbs, such as *is, ensure, protect* (without a qualifier), *promise, guarantee,* or *secure.*
- Avoid images that might imply absolute security, safety, or privacy, such as padlocks, fortresses, vaults, or safes.
- Use security terms properly. [Learn how.](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/security-safety-privacy-terms.md)
- Use the [Security & privacy messaging checklist](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/sitepages/marketing-and-advertising-content-security-privacy.aspx) on CELAWeb to ensure that your security, safety, and privacy content meets legal requirements. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
- Whether you’re writing for teenagers or IT pros, keep your audience’s knowledge of security technology and tolerance for risk in mind.
- Request a review from [your group's paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/) if your content is primarily about security, safety, or privacy, or if you have any questions. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
- Review the [Microsoft Security Guidelines for Covered Services](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B57CC6441-9E14-4518-8FF6-EA15C759B65F%7D&file=Microsoft_Security_Guidelines_For_Covered_Services_Marketing.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&wdLOR=cE3C7CB12-DA09-4B09-BA7F-3553588AD183&cid=6b3345fb-0932-4d03-a6b2-80869f71c243) if you're writing about Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live ID), Passport, Windows Marketplace, mobile, or portions of Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) and CX (formerly MX).
