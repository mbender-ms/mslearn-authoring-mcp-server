# Design-planning checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Think about design before you start writing. 

- Stay in close touch with your designer, if you have one.
- Understand design options and limitations if you’re writing blog posts or for social media.
- If you’re starting from scratch without a designer, use a template. Check [Brand Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Search/Pages/BCTemplatesResults.aspx?k=microsoft) if your team doesn’t have a template. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) 
- For information about designing a Microsoft website, see the [design and content resources](https://wmc.azurewebsites.net/resource-library/?refine=Design%20and%20content) on the Microsoft Website Management Center. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
- Make layout decisions before you start. If you're working on a platform with limited design choices, find out which layout works best.
- Position content elements in the same place on every page if you can.
