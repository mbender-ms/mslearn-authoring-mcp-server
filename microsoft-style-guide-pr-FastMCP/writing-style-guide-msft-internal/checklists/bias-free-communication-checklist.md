# Bias-free communication checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Microsoft is working to help everyone around the world achieve more. In line with that mission, use bias-free language in your content:

- Use gender-neutral or inclusive terms to refer to people. Avoid compound words containing *man* or *men*.
- Avoid gendered pronouns. Rewrite to use the second person (*you*), or refer to a person's role, such as *employee* or *client*.
- Use realistic examples of diverse individuals from all walks of life participating fully in activities. Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class.
- Be inclusive of job roles, family structure, and leisure activities.
- Avoid stereotypes in job roles. Refer to people of varied ethnic backgrounds and gender identities across professions.
- Focus on the person, not the disability.
- Don't use slang that could be considered cultural appropriation.
- Don't use profane or derogatory terms, such as *pimp* or *bitch*.
- Don't use culturally sensitive terms as metaphors for technology, such as *demilitarized zone*.
- Be careful with references and images related to cities, countries, and regions, especially disputed regions. To learn more, see the [Global Readiness article library](https://aka.ms/GROArticleLibrary). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
