# UI text and design checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Well-designed UI feels like a conversation. These tips will help get you there.

## Be simple, straightforward, and human

- Write in informal, conversational Microsoft voice. (Use short, everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization.)   
- Read UI aloud. Is it conversational, clear, and concise? Keep revising until it is.
- Don't use technical jargon or acronyms.

## Put the customer at the center

- Understand your customers. Then tailor the experience to their needs.  
- Design around the customer’s primary intent—what the customer is trying to accomplish.  
- Always consider the context and the customer’s frame of mind during a specific interaction.
- Reach out to your usability researchers, and use their insights.

## Design great content

- Participate in the project kickoff. Advocate for the customer throughout.
- Design for customer scenarios. Put the most important information, action, or issue in the most noticeable spot.   
- Ban *lorem ipsum.* Always design with real, plausible text in the early stages. Then revise until it's just right.
- Don’t get in the way. Great content is invisible. Prune every excess word and remove unnecessary details.
- Consider what those button labels and words mean to customers. Make it clear what will happen when they choose an option or select a link. 
- Use the same terms consistently for fundamental commands, menu items, and labels.
- Apply Microsoft voice guidelines until your text reads like a conversation with a friend. To learn more, see [Brand voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human).
- Collaborate with design and PM partners, usability researchers, and peers to identify issues as you revise.
- Apply style rules. Sweat the details, like sentence-style capitalization and punctuation. To learn more, see [Capitalization](/style-guide/capitalization) and [Punctuation](/style-guide/punctuation).
- When something works, consider using it as a pattern you can reuse.
- Keep a style sheet, and contribute to your UX team's guidance.
