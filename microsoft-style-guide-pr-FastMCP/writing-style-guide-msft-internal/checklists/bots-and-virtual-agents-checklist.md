## Top tips for UX content design of bots and virtual agents

- Be clear that the customer is chatting with a bot, not a person, and explain what the bot can and can't do.
- Tailor the tone of the bot's responses (for example, serious, lighthearted, businesslike) to the context.
- Clarify and disambiguate the customer's intent when necessary.
- Use buttons and other UI structure to guide the conversation. Invite the customer into the conversation on a regular basis by asking questions or making suggestions.
- Break up messages into short, readable blocks, and make sure the bot doesn't respond so quickly that it rushes the customer.
- Make sure your bot recognizes and responds to words that customers are familiar with, like *help, settings, start over,* and *stop*.
- Accommodate alternative word order and incomplete requests.
- Make sure your bot can handle common misspellings and errors in the customer's input.
- Plan for the bot's limitations. How will the bot respond when it doesn't know the answer?
- If the bot is taking a while to process the customer's request, use the typing indicator or have the bot say, "I'm thinking."
- Plan how the bot responds when users start to play games with itâ€”for example, asking nonsense questions.
- Wrap up the conversation when the request is resolved.
- Have a plan for maintaining and evolving the bot. The plan should include knowing when it's time to retire your bot.
