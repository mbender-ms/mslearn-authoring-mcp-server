# Developer content checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Be warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand to your developer audience. Skip the basics, and get right to the technology and product information they need.

## Reference documentation

- Use consistent design, headings, and structure to help developers find the information they need quickly.
- Check your group's editorial style guide for specific information about documenting your product.
- In titles, use the name of the programming element, followed by the element type (for example, *Clear Method*). If multiple elements share the name, add a differentiator, such as the parent element name or product or technology name (for example, *Device.Clear Method*), to help customers find the right information in search results.
- Include all required elements with clear and helpful details in each reference article.
- If you autogenerate reference documentation, make sure it includes all details that are important to customers and remove anything extraneous.

## Code examples

Create code examples for tasks and scenarios that are meaningful for your audience. Code examples that demonstrate product features are useful only when they address the problems developers are trying to solve.

- Create concise examples that exemplify key development tasks. Start with simple, common scenarios and build complexity.
- Prioritize frequently used elements and elements that are tricky to use.
- Create code examples that are easy to understand, but skip obvious or contrived scenarios.
- Introduce each scenario, and cover requirements and dependencies.
- Write reusable code. Include comments to explain details that arenâ€™t obvious.
- Show expected output.
- Consider accessibility requirements for code that creates UI.
- Write secure code.
- Show exception handling only when it's intrinsic to the example.
- Compile and test the code.
- Provide an easy way for developers to copy and run the code.
- Use keywords, linking strategies, and other SEO techniques to help developers find the code. To learn more, see [Search and writing](/style-guide/search-writing).

## Formatting text elements

- Format text elements consistently to help readers locate and interpret information more easily.
