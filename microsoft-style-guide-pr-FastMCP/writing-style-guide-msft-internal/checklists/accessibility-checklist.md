# Accessibility checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Microsoft creates technology that's accessible to people of all abilities. Accessible content and user experiences meet the [Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/accessibility/SitePages/Microsoft-Accessibility-Standards-(MAS).aspx) requirements, which cover software and hardware development, web content, and other forms of content, including audio, video, animations, images, and interactive content. (The Microsoft Accessibility Standards page requires Microsoft network access.) This checklist will get you started.

**Learn more** about [Accessibility guidelines and requirements](/style-guide/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements).

## Writing

- Create text alternatives (alt text) for all elements other than text.
- Follow Microsoft voice guidelines to create brief, clear, and focused content.
- Write short, descriptive link text that maps to or clearly describes the destination link. If possible, use at least two visual cues—color and underline, for example—to distinguish links.
- Use headings, tables, and lists to organize content logically, to emphasize key points, and to reinforce relationships between data and concepts. Always use header rows in tables.
- Don't use directional terms (*left, right, up, down, above,* and *below*) as the only clue to location. If you must use a directional term, describe the location, too: *in the title bar,* for example.
- In documentation, cover all input methods and describe all supported modes of interaction, input commands, and keyboard shortcuts.
- In procedures and instructions, use generic verbs that work with any input method. To learn more, see [Describing interactions with UI](/style-guide/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui).

## Colors and patterns

- Don’t convey information using any single sensory cue—color, sound, pattern, or otherwise. Use multiple cues, such as color, pattern, and text.
- Don’t use low-contrast or hard-to-read color combinations. Instead, follow minimum contrast standards and provide high-contrast alternatives. To learn more, see page 5 of [the brand color guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Guidelines/Microsoft_color_guidelines.pdf). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
- Don’t use screens or tints in art. Don't use patterns or images behind text.

## Graphics, design, and media

- Try to keep webpage and UI design simple, within a rectangular grid.
- Design webpages to support known reading patterns.
- Support Tab key navigation in webpages and UI.
- Provide a version of each webpage without frames.
- Avoid embedding text in images. If you do, use alt text to describe the embedded text.
- Use alt text to describe all meaningful image elements other than text. Use NULL text for images that are decorative. If the description is too long for alt text, consider adding it to the content adjacent to the element or providing a link to a more extensive description.
- For audio and video content, provide closed-captioning, transcripts, and/or descriptions. (Video content requires both closed-captioning and audio descriptions.)
- Provide text links in addition to image maps.

## Terminology

- Always put people before the disability. For example, refer to a person who is blind, not a blind person.
- Use recommended terms when you describe specific disabilities or people with specific disabilities. To learn more, see the [Accessibility term collection](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms).
