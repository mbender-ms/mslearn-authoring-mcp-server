# New products checklist

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

- Follow the five-step, formal naming process when you're developing a new name. [Learn more](~/new-products/name-development.md).
- Use *preview*, not *beta*, to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Lowercase *preview* in generic references.
- Use *Product Name Preview*, if possible, to refer to prerelease versions of software and services. [Learn more](~/new-products/product-previews.md).
- Follow CELAWeb [Code name guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-code-names.aspx) before you create or use code names for existing products, new offerings, or acquisitions. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
- Get all required approvals before using code names in external communications. [Learn more](~/new-products/code-names.md).
- Avoid using code names in documentation.
- Provide accurate system requirements for all products, including trial, evaluation, and preview products and products and services obtained digitally. [Learn more](~/new-products/system-requirements.md).
