# Legal content checklist

Knowing and following Microsoft’s legal standards in content helps protect our intellectual property and minimizes legal risks. This checklist provides an overview of the most common legal issues in content. For complete information, visit [CELAWeb](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb). (This site requires Microsoft network access.) If you have a question, reach out to your [CELA contact](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (This site requires Microsoft network access.) 

## Legal issues and content

- Use the checklists on the [Marketing self-service page](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/checklists.aspx) to make sure you’ve covered all legal bases for specific types of content, including blogs, email, presentations, training material, websites, white papers, and more.

- Before distributing content or software globally, make sure Microsoft has international distribution rights and that royalties aren't affected by international distribution.
- Protect Microsoft brands by using approved product and service names, even if the name isn’t trademarked. Always spell out a trademarked name, and don’t use it as a possessive, plural, or verb.

## Fictitious names, domains, and addresses
