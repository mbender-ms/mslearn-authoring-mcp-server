# Headings

[!INCLUDE [Headings](~/../includes/headings.md)]

## Guidelines for Microsoft authors

*This section is Microsoft confidential.*

Follow Microsoft Brand Guidelines for heading fonts. The heading font is
often larger than the one used for body text. Sometimes it's a heavier
weight or a different color. Done well, these distinct font treatments
help attract users to the heading. Your template probably includes at
least four heading styles. You don't have to, and usually shouldn't,
use them all.

If you don't have a template, limit yourself to no more than two fonts
in headings (for example, Segoe UI Semibold and Segoe UI).
