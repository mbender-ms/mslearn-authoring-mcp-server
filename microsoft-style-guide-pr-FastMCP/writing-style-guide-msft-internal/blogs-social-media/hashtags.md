# Hashtags

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Hashtags provide context and draw readers into conversations on X (formerly known as Twitter) and other social media and in Outlook.  

Follow these guidelines to use hashtags effectively and in a positive way.  

**Keep your hashtags short (4 to 10 characters),** and make them easy to remember and easy to spell.  

**Examples**  
#MSIgnite  
#MinecraftEdu  

**Use hashtags that are easy to use in a sentence.** Nouns work better than verbs.  

**Example** Good morning, Atlanta! #MSIgnite starts in 1 hour!  

**Make it simple and straightforward.** Don’t overthink your hashtag or get cute or complicated. Your hashtag should be immediately understandable.  

**When selecting a hashtag, always check to see how others are using it.** In some cases, it’s helpful to use a hashtag that’s already being used by others, such as #AI or #IoT, to draw readers who are interested in that topic. You might also find that a competitor or bad actor is already using a hashtag in a way that isn’t ideal or positive for the Microsoft brand.
