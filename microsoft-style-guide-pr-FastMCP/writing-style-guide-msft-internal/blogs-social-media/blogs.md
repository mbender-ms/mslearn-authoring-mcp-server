# Blogs

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Blogs are a good way to provide customers with ongoing, regular communications from subject matter experts as well as customer stories and breaking news. If you decide to blog, be prepared to update your blog weekly. A stale blog creates customer dissatisfaction and affects your credibility. An active, credible blog invites customer comments and community promotion. Blog posts can contain text, images, and videos.

Before you blog, read the [Microsoft blogging and social media guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/promotions-facebook-twitter-pinterest.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

The following tips will help you create and maintain a fresh and interesting blog.

**Blog regularly but judiciously.** A good rule of thumb is at least one meaningful blog post a week. Consider a team blog to share the workload. If you don't have something useful or interesting to talk about, it's better to skip a blog than to post extraneous content.

**Identify and schedule blog topics in advance.** With a plan in place, you can prepare for each post and let readers know whatâ€™s coming up. An editorial schedule is especially helpful for team blogs.

**Be yourself.** Keep your tone friendly and informal to encourage conversation. To learn more, see [Brand voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human).

**Use common sense.** Follow the same guidelines that you would in any interaction or communication with customers, partners, and the press.

**Respond promptly to customer comments.** Customer comments can be excellent feedback for your product team. Your responses amplify customer engagement and foster a perception of transparency and responsiveness.

**Add a disclaimer to archived posts.** Something like this: *To the best of my [our] knowledge, this post was accurate at the time of publication, but it might not be accurate now. I [we] recommend that you search the web for a more recent source.*

**Tag each blog post** with keywords to help readers find related posts and search for posts about topics they care about.

**Use social media,** such as X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook, to raise awareness about new posts.
