# Blogs and social media

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

More and more, we communicate with customers through blogs, communities, and other forms of social media. These forms of communication tend to be shorter, more spontaneous, and more frequent than the formal content we relied on in the past. Plus, they often allow readers to contribute.

This section will help you manage blogs and other social media and grow communities.

Before you begin, read the [Microsoft blogging and social media guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb-marketing/sitepages/social-media-social-media-guidelines.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
