# Communities

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

The web has evolved from a source of information to a place where people share expertise and learn from others. Customers expect to interact with digital content.

Consider offering customers a way to provide content on your site—all customers, or a few you select. If you do, establish submission standards and have a plan in place to manage content for appropriateness, accuracy, and adherence to standards. It’s a good idea to contact [your group's paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/) and your [Global Readiness contact](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness/SitePages/Contacts.aspx) before launching a new community submission program. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)

There are plenty of ways for customers to contribute content, from commenting to submitting media, tips, templates, and more. Microsoft hosts [community forums](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us) for many programs. They're a great way to see what’s on your customers’ minds.

Most community programs have editors, content managers, or councils in place to ensure that content is appropriate, to encourage submissions and conversations, to arbitrate disagreements, and to respond to feedback. Make sure you have the time and resources to manage a community program before you begin.

An enthusiastic community, such as a highly engaged technical community with lots of expertise to share, is a good place to start. Include employees with expertise, such as program managers, developers, marketers, support, sales, or anyone else with expertise and a vested interest.

Community content can include:

- Troubleshooting and workarounds
- Tips and tricks
- Best practices
- Interoperability information
- Scenario-based or solution-based content
- Product evaluations
- Content about preview software
- White papers
- Community or wiki lists
- Learning road maps

Wikis, such as the [TechNet wiki](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/), are a great way to collaborate with customers and your internal community on content that Microsoft might not otherwise provide. For content that can't be released yet, use a private wiki with limited participants. Start your wiki with an idea of how you'll organize the content. Most wikis don’t have a standard table of contents, but you can create one or more navigation articles to provide links to other articles.

To encourage contribution, create *stub topics:* partially completed topic drafts that the community can add to. Start with content that encourages contribution, such as troubleshooting or tips and tricks, and experiment from there. Make sure your product, legal, and localization contacts support your efforts, and be open to change based on community feedback.

If tagging is available on the community platform, tag entries with keywords to help readers find related entries and search for posts about topics they care about.

Use social media to promote interesting content and to encourage community contributions.
