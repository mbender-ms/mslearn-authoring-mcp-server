# Security, safety, and privacy content

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Absolute security, privacy, and safety don't exist. When you write about those topics, be reassuring but realistic.

Don’t make unconditional statements about security, safety, or privacy. Similarly, avoid images that might imply absolute security, safety, or privacy, such as padlocks, fortresses, vaults, and safes.  

When you write about these subjects, avoid absolute verbs, such as *is, ensure, protect, promise, guarantee,* or *secure.* Instead, talk about product features, technologies, and initiatives that help customers achieve security, safety, or privacy.

**Examples**

- Outlook’s antiphishing technology scans incoming mail automatically.  
- BitLocker encryption helps to protect your data.

Use qualifiers or self-comparisons with words like *safe, private, privacy,* *secure,* and their synonyms or derivatives. For example, add *more, helps, can help, improve,* or *can improve.* Direct comparison to competitors must be backed by evidence from cited sources. General self-comparisons to other Microsoft tools and products are OK.

**Examples**

- Improve data security by deploying Microsoft Endpoint Protection technology.  
- BitLocker is a data protection feature that encrypts drives on your computer to help prevent data theft or exposure.  
- Use location services more safely by adjusting your settings.  
- Stay safer online with business-grade security.

Know your audience. A teenager and an IT pro have different knowledge of security technologies and tolerance for risk. Write accordingly.

Request a review from [your CELA rep](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/) if your content is primarily about security, safety, or privacy, or if you have any questions. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
