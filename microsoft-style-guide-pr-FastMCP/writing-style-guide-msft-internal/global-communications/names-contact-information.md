# Names and contact information

[!INCLUDE [Names and contact information](<~/../includes/names-contact-information.md>)]

## Guidelines for Microsoft authors

*This section is Microsoft confidential.*

Adhere to the [Privacy and security](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Compliance/SitePages/regulatory-compliance.aspx) guidelines on CELAWeb when you collect personal information. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) Many countries strictly control what personal information can be legally collected, stored, and shared. Before collecting personal data outside the United States, check with your international program manager and your [group's paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

### Forms that collect information: Names

Refer to [Article 1708: Personal name formats](https://aka.ms/GROPersonalNames) on the [Global Readiness](https://aka.ms/GRO) website for the correct ordering of first and last names in various cultures. The article also has guidelines for using the personal name formats available on the [Regional Formats](https://aka.ms/GRORegionalFormats) page. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

### For communications that use the customer's name

For the correct ordering of first and last names in various cultures, see [Article 1708: Personal name formats](https://aka.ms/GROPersonalNames) on the Global Readiness website. This article also has guidelines for using the personal name formats available on the [Regional Formats](https://aka.ms/GRORegionalFormats) page. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) 

### Contact information for Microsoft and third parties

- If you're providing information about how to contact Microsoft, remember that toll-free telephone numbers aren't always available worldwide. Provide an alternate way for customers to contact Microsoft. If appropriate, link to [https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide).
-   Avoid references to third-party companies and organizations in the United States. In particular, avoid referring customers to US
    resources. If you must provide a vendor, supplier, or retailer
    reference, state that it's a US company or organization, and
    suggest where customers outside the United States can look for local
    resources.
