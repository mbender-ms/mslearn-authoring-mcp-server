# How to use this guide

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Welcome to the internal Microsoft Writing Style Guide! The style guide is hosted on Microsoft Learn, which offers a user-friendly and centralized experience. On the Learn platform, confidential content is permissioned. This means that internal-only articles or sections within an article are only accessible to users who sign in with an authorized Microsoft Learn profile. Only Microsoft internal personnel (FTE, v-, and a-) will be authorized for access. Articles that contain confidential content are marked with a key icon in the table of contents. Additionally, Microsoft-only content is clearly labeled within the article, making it easy for you to find internal resources.  

To get started:

1. Review the list of [Microsoft style references](~/welcome/microsoft-style-references.md). Use your group's editorial style guide as your primary reference, and then the _Microsoft Writing Style Guide_ for other matters of style and voice.  

2. Check out the [Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice](/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice) to learn simple guidelines that will make a big difference in your content.  

3. Review the [Checklists](/style-guide/checklists) section. If you need more information, head for the full article in the related section. If you're new to Microsoft or new to writing for Microsoft, this is a great place to start. Skimming through the checklists, you'll quickly figure out what you already know and start filling in the gaps for what you don't.

**Note** Anyone with a Microsoft.com email account or partner credentials can use this guide. If other key vendors or business partners require access, ask the Microsoft project manager to compile a list of their Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live ID) email addresses, and send them to [msstyle@microsoft.com](mailto:msstyle@microsoft.com) to request permission. Some links require Microsoft network access and might be unavailable to users with Microsoft accounts.
