# Microsoft Editorial Board

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Microsoft-wide questions of style are managed by the Microsoft Editorial Board, which represents products, organizations, channels, roles, and lines of business across the company. The Editorial Board works closely with the [Microsoft Brand Studio](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/) to align editorial style and voice across everything we do. (The Brand Central site requires Microsoft network access.)
