# Microsoft style references

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Donâ€™t use Microsoft.com, any other webpage, or product UI as a source for product and feature names, capitalization, terminology, or grammar and usage.

Stick with these trustworthy resources, and use them in this order:

1. Consider your product group's style guide as your primary reference.
2. Then use the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide* for other matters of style and voice.
3. Determine whether another team has already addressed your issue by searching this style guide and product group guides, such as [the *Microsoft Product Style Guide*](/product-style-guide-msft-internal/welcome/welcome).
4. Check trademark names on the [Microsoft Corporation trademarks list](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
5. Check product names in the corporate taxonomy:
   - Go to [the Microsoft corporate taxonomy](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/corptaxbrowse/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
   - In the left navigation, open Corporate tagging taxonomies > Products for tagging, and then find the product name.
   - Use [*Merriam-Webster Dictionary*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for spelling and usage not covered in this guide. If *Merriam-Webster* lists alternative spellings for a word, use the first one.
6. Visit [Microsoft Brand Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/brandcentral) for visual assets, brand guidelines, and templates. And the [Docs Help style guide](/help/) if you're writing technical content or documentation for the Docs.Microsoft.com site. See the [Microsoft Website Management Center](https://wmc.azurewebsites.net/) for Microsoft.com design standards. (These sites require Microsoft network access.)
7. For answers to style questions not covered in this guide or general questions about grammar and punctuation, see [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).
