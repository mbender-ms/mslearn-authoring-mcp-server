# Use technical terms carefully

[!INCLUDE [Use technical terms carefully](~/../includes/use-technical-terms-carefully.md)]

## Guidelines for Microsoft authors

*This section is Microsoft confidential.*

In addition to the guidelines above when researching emerging terminology:

- Get feedback from related product teams.
- If it's a new name—whether for a product or service, a feature, a
    campaign, an event, or an internal tool—reach out to your product
    marketing team or engage in your group's established process for
    name development. Get a [geopolitical
    review](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/NewNameReview.aspx),
    and include legal and branding teams in the naming process. To learn
    more, see the [Brand Central naming
    guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Identity-Naming.aspx). (These
    sites require Microsoft network access.)

**Global tip**: If possible, check [Term Studio](https://aka.ms/termstudio) or
contact your localization team to comment on any localization
implications of new terms and usage. (Term Studio requires Microsoft
network access.)
