# Security terms 

[!INCLUDE [security-terms](~/../includes/security-terms.md)]

## Guidelines for Microsoft authors

*This section is Microsoft confidential.*

Don't use words that imply security, safety, or privacy without qualification. Instead, focus statements on features. For example, say *Outlook uses antiphishing technology to scan incoming mail automatically,* not *Outlook helps protect your computer from phishing.*

Use your judgment and check with [your group's paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)  

See [Security, safety, and privacy content](~/security-safety-and-privacy-content.md) for more information.

### Trigger words and qualifiers

If you must use any of the trigger words in the following table, use the
accompanying qualifiers to avoid promising absolute security, safety, or
privacy. Also, don't use these terms to compare Microsoft
technology with the competition.
