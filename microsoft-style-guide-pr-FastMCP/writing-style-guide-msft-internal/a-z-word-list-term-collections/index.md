# A–Z word list and term collections

Don't use Microsoft.com, any other web page, or product UI as a source
for product and feature names, capitalization, spelling, and usage.

Stick with these trustworthy resources, and use them in this order. 

1. Consider your group's editorial style guide to be your primary reference.
2. Refer to the A--Z word list and term collections to find Microsoft guidelines for capitalization, spelling, and usage.
3. Use [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for spelling and usage  not covered in this guide. 

For general information about deciding which words to use, see [Word choice](/style-guide/word-choice/).
