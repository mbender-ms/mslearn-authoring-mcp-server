# Procedures and instructions

[!INCLUDE [Procedures and instructions](~/../includes/procedures-instructions.md)]

## Guidelines for Microsoft authors

*This section is Microsoft confidential.*

In addition to the general guidelines for writing procedures and instructions, Microsoft authors should follow these guidelines:

* When developing help or documentation content, the best procedure is the one users don't need. If the UI is crystal clear and leads the customer through a task, a how-to procedure isn't necessary. Start there, with the product\'s Content Design team. (See [UI text and design](~//ui-text-and-content-design.md) for specific tips.)
* Document all the ways that customers can interact with your UI, to comply with [Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/accessibility/SitePages/Microsoft-Accessibility-Standards-(MAS).aspx) requirements and support customers of all abilities
