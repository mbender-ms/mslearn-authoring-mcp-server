# Copyrights and trademarks

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

This section covers how you can help to protect intellectual property by following the correct guidelines for copyrights and trademarks. For more in-depth information, see [Copyrights Trademarks and Patents](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/Copyrightshome.aspx) on CELAWeb. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) If you have a question, reach out to [your CELA contact](https://findcontact.microsoft.com). (This site requires Microsoft network access.) 

## Microsoft copyrights

Pages on Microsoft.com include a standard footer that covers copyright and other legal requirements for Microsoft websites. You don't need to do anything else to protect Microsoft materials published on Microsoft.com sites. For more information, see the [Universal Header and Footer](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/WebsiteManagementCenter/SitePages/UHF-(Universal-Header-and-Footer).aspx?csf=1&web=1&share=ER2lFLSb3IpLh9qYCdqLN8wB9_5QoEhkV5hNSTdr1pD2bA&e=x9L3YF&OR=Teams-HL&CT=1723659494008&CID=974446a1-70c0-1000-195a-d6f7beaffd8c&cidOR=SPO) on the Microsoft Website Management Center. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

Marketing materials and press releases don't require copyright notices. Marketing materials include any communication designed to influence a purchase decision. Most other downloadable or printed content requires a copyright notice. Follow the [CELA guidelines for creating copyright notices](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/copyrights-legal-notices.aspx). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

## Third-party copyrights

Before using an illustration, photo, video, song, or other audio or video content, license all necessary rights, including publicity rights, and the rights to publish in other countries if necessary. Even if a Microsoft employee took a photo, you need permission to use it. To learn more about image and media rights, see [Using third-party content](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/copyrights-third-party-content.aspx?web=1) on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

Before quoting, citing, linking to, or using copyrighted content from third parties, check with [your CELA contact](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (This site requires Microsoft network access.) When you use third-party content, make sure you quote it exactly and include the required citations, which may vary for types of content and across content sources.

## Microsoft trademarks

Your actions as a writer help protect Microsoft trademarks. Trademark guidelines vary depending on the type of content you create and the product or service you're writing about. In general:

- Use the complete trademarked name, instead of an [abbreviation or acronym](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-acronyms-abbreviations.aspx). (This site requires Microsoft network access).
- Use approved product and service names and branding, even if the name isn't trademarked.
- Don't use possessive, plural, or verb forms of Microsoft trademarks. Use Microsoft trademarks as directed in the [brand architecture](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks) and any product specific guidelines. (This site requires Microsoft network access).
- Follow the guidance in the [Trademark list & attribution requirements page](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-list-and-usage.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDJ8di1zcmFpbGxhcmRAbWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbXxkZTUyNjJlMGVmNjY0NDQ4ODNiMzA4ZGNhZmU3YWVlN3w3MmY5ODhiZjg2ZjE0MWFmOTFhYjJkN2NkMDExZGI0N3wxfDB8NjM4NTc4NjU2ODEwMDIyMDI5fFVua25vd258VFdGcGJHWnNiM2Q4ZXlKV0lqb2lNQzR3TGpBd01EQWlMQ0pRSWpvaVYybHVNeklpTENKQlRpSTZJazFoYVd3aUxDSlhWQ0k2TW4wPXwwfHx8&sdata=aTdQOC90cFU4MG9YL0I3cTFINHZTT1dhOFUyMXh4MDQrcTh4Zncwa0ZkUT0%3d) when using Microsoft trademarks in software, products, packaging, books, manuals, or a Microsoft website. (This site requires Microsoft network access).

## Third-party trademarks

Don't use a third party's logo, trademark, images, or other intellectual property, unless:

- Our proposed use is permitted by the third party's online trademark guidelines.
- Microsoft has explicit permission to use a third party's trademarks and IP assets as part of an agreement, or as a separate written permission received from the third party.
- [Your CELA Contact](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/) has reviewed and approved your proposed use. (This site requires Microsoft network access).

Include trademark symbols and a footnote for third-party trademarks only when a contract with the company requires it, typically as part of a license agreement. Each business group maintains its own agreements. Work with your internal partners—often product managers—and your [CELA contact](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/) to comply with contractual requirements regarding third-party trademarks.
