# Fictitious names, domains, and addresses

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

We use realistic scenarios to create stories around Microsoft products, incorporate details into demos, and clarify instructions. If you need fictitious content for scenarios—names, business names, product names, URLs—select them from the [fictitious content](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-fictitious-names.aspx) provided on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) You’ll find:

- Fictitious company names and URLs.
- A tool for finding approved names of people in many languages.
- Instructions for creating addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, names of places (such as schools), and logo treatments.

In the rare instances where available fictitious content doesn’t meet your needs, the Trademark group will review new fictitious content if your request meets certain criteria. See [Approved fictitious names & guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-fictitious-names.aspx) on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

## Domain names

If you need to use a generic domain name or URL in content, use _Example.com_, _Example.org_, or _Example.net_. These domain names are reserved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for use in documentation examples. You can also use Microsoft.com or the home page of your product website. Don’t use other domain names, which may be owned by individuals or companies.

## IP addresses
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has set aside several ranges of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for use on intranets. These IP addresses are documented in Internet RFC 1918 and are guaranteed never to correspond to any real-world computer on the internet. They include:

- 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255, inclusive  
- 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255, inclusive  
- 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255, inclusive 

You can use any address within those ranges as an example. For maximum realism, choose an address that doesn't contain zeros from one of the latter two blocks.

If you have a question about using fictitious content, contact [your group’s paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
