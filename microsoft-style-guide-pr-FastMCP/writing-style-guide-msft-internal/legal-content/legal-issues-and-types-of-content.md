# Legal issues and types of content

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Different types of content require different legal coverage. For instance, testimonials require a signed [quote permission form](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B16C5C05E-65E8-4E59-926E-1D1AF4BEAEBD%7D&file=Quote_Permission_Form_Marketing.doc&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&wdLOR=c5F938D84-3966-43B6-A66D-B54241C5C91A&cid=0710428b-4eeb-4317-97e8-95f57e9ee4b8). (This page requires Microsoft network access.) And tweeting, posting, pinning, and engaging with customers on Microsoft's behalf requires you familiarize yourself with the rules in [Guidelines for engaging with social media](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb-marketing/sitepages/social-media-social-media-guidelines.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

Request a legal review for:

- Positioning and messaging frameworks
- Press releases (Microsoft and joint releases)
- Product datasheets
- Product packaging
- Offers, including promotions, contests and games of skill, sweepstakes, rebates, bundles, discounts, and free items, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding. (See [Clearing offers with LCA](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/marketing-and-advertising-content-offers.aspx) to learn more.
