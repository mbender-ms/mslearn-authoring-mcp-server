# Acronyms

[!INCLUDE [Acronyms](~/../includes/acronyms.md)]


## Guidelines for Microsoft authors

*This section is Microsoft confidential.*

### Don't create acronyms from product or feature names

Always spell out Microsoft product and feature names to protect our
trademarks and brand names. Exceptions require approval from CELA and
your Brand Director—see your group's style guide for details.

### Only use acronyms that your audience is familiar with

Check your group's editorial style guide to see whether an acronym is
appropriate for your content. The [A--Z word list](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/index.md) also has guidelines for many common acronyms, and some acronyms are so widely used that they're in the *[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).*
