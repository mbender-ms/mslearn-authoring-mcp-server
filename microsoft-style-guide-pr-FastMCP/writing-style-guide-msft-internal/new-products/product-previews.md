# Product previews

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Prerelease versions of software and services are typically identified as *Product Name Preview* (preferred) or *Code Name Preview*. Do not use *Public Preview* or *Private Preview*.

To indicate a feature is in preview, follow the name with _(preview)_.

In generic references, lowercase _preview_.

Avoid using _beta_ to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Use _preview_ instead.

**Examples**  
Office 2016 Preview  
Windows 10 Insider Preview  
Microsoft Power BI Preview  
A preview of Azure Container Service is available.

Previews are subject to different terms and conditions than major releases. Check with [your group's paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/) for details. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
