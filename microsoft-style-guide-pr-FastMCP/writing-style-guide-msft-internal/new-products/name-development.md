# Name development

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

If you’re developing a new name—whether for a product or service, a feature, a campaign or program, an event, or an internal tool—reach out to your product marketing team or engage in your group’s established process for name development. Get a [geopolitical review](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/NewNameReview.aspx), and include legal and branding teams in the naming process.

**Learn more** For information about the naming process, see the [Brand Central naming guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Identity-Naming.aspx). For Microsoft's approach to localizing names, see the [Brand Central name localization guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Guidelines/Microsoft_naming_playbook_Localization.pdf).
