# System requirements

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

Accurate system requirements for products, services, and downloads enhance the customer experience as well as minimize legal risk. This is true for trial, evaluation, and prerelease or preview products, too.

There are plenty of options for documenting system requirements. Starting with system requirements from the previous version can speed things up. Keep these guidelines in mind:

- Follow the [System requirements guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Marketing/SitePages/packaging-system-requirements.aspx) on CELAWeb, and discuss your ideas with [your group's paralegal](https://findcontact.microsoft.com/). (These pages require Microsoft network access.)
- If customers obtain a product digitally, make sure the system requirements are available via a prominent link on the purchase or download page. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a webpage for system requirements for packaged products, too.
