# Code names

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

**Creating code names**

When developing a new product, service, or other offering, you might need to create a temporary project name, or code name, to refer to your project until the final name is available. Although code names are generally intended for internal use only, circumstances may require some external use, or it may be unintentionally disclosed.  

Any name entails legal risks, therefore, it’s important to review and follow these CELA [Code name guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/SitePages/trademarks-code-names.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

**Using code names in external communications**

After you create your code name, follow these guidelines for its use. If possible, use the final name rather than a code name in external communications. If you intentionally use the code name externally:  

- State explicitly that the name is a code name or temporary project name. 
- Precede the code name by the term Code Name or Project, followed by the code name in quotation marks.

**Examples**

Microsoft is working on a new project, Code Name “Chicago.” 

Microsoft has released some information on Project “Denver.”​ 

- Avoid repeating the code name multiple times. Replace it with general terms like “this product” or “this program.” 
- Don’t make any external use of mascots, icons, or logos related to the code name.  
- Be careful to replace all instances of the code name when the official name is confirmed.
- Never use code names in file names, art, screenshots, context IDs, or link text.
