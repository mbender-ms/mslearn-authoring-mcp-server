# UI text and content design

*This article is Microsoft confidential.*

We need storytellers at the heart of product development. The UI is the most tactile, immediate, and visible way people interact with us—and our most powerful tool for delivering great customer experiences. Ultimately, those great experiences are based on understanding our customers and tailoring experiences to their needs.

## Be simple, straightforward, and human

In products, we don’t need more content—we need content that does more. Content that’s simple, straightforward, and human.

Use these tips for writing in tight spaces.

- **Get to the point fast.** Start with the key takeaway. Make choices and next steps obvious. Provide customers with just enough information that they can make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word.

- **Talk like a person.** Use an informal, conversational tone—like you’re talking one-on-one.

- **Keep it simple.** Use simply structured, plain language. Write short sentences and fragments that are easy to scan and read. Break up complex information—lead with what’s most important, and create layers for any details that are critical to the task at hand.

## Put the customer at the center

CEO Satya Nadella said, “Obsessing over our customers is everybody’s job.” When you’re writing UI, it’s your job to know both your audience and how they experience the product. To better understand customer experiences:

- **Live the brand like a customer.** Use Microsoft products on every platform and device. Be curious and observant. Think about how the experience can be better.

- **Reach out to your usability researchers.** Use their insights to help your team identify and meet real customer needs. Watch customers in the lab now and then, too.

As you shape UI text, know the answers to these questions:

- **Who is the customer?** Will everyone see this screen? Or is it for advanced users only?

- **What is the customer trying to do?** (This is different from, What do we *want* the customer to do?) Is this screen a step in a larger task or customer goal? A warning, an error, or a notification?

- **What is the customer’s frame of mind?** Are they wondering if something has gone wrong? Mad because they can't sign in? Confused about which option is best? Happy to have completed a task? Adjust your tone accordingly.

## Design content for customer needs

Good content meets the customer's needs. Great content exceeds them. The words you choose should be easy to understand, have the right amount of information, and guide the customer to the right action for that person at that time. Here’s a way to approach it:

1. **Participate in the project kickoff.** Your group likely has its own process for briefing teams on work items and developing conceptual flows. Get involved as far upstream as you can. Be an advocate for customers and meeting their needs.

2. **Start with the why,** continue with the how, and then move to the what. Early in the process, ignore the words and focus on the process flow from end to end.

   - Ask PMs for missing details about the scenario—do you understand what's happening well enough to explain it?
   - Use the same questions that journalists rely on: who, what, when, where, why, and how.
   - Sketch out or mock up the flow with your design partner and PM, and then discuss alternatives.

3. **Temporarily set aside voice and style guidelines.** You'll apply them later, but applying them too early may constrain creativity. With the mockup in hand, write preliminary content for each screen element.

   - Always write preliminary content—or at least write draft text as a placeholder.
   - Don’t use Greek text (lorem ipsum) as a placeholder. It conceals usability and design issues until late in the process, when they're harder to fix.

4. **Provide enough information,** but not too much.

   - Try to explain the scenario as if you're talking to a friend who’s not particularly technical. Then read the real text aloud—does it capture what you want to communicate?
   - Look for text that can be combined for brevity or separated to make it simpler.
   - Remove any details that aren’t absolutely essential.

5. **Put yourself in your customer’s shoes.** What do they need to know? Did you explain it succinctly and clearly?

   - If it’s not clear how to do something, clarify it in the interface text. Consider showing examples.
   - If a task seems cumbersome, define the key tasks, break apart big decisions, prioritize features, and simplify customer interactions.
   - If it still doesn’t seem like the task will be easy and intuitive for customers, consider bringing in your peers to review it for a fresh perspective.

6. **Apply Microsoft voice guidelines.** Revise the content until the voice is conversational, clear, and concise. At each point in the task flow, map the tone to the customer's likely frame of mind. To learn more, see [Brand voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human).

7. **Collaborate.** Walk through your content with design and PM partners and peers to identify potential issues. Use their feedback in addition to insights gained from usability research to revise.

8. **Apply style rules.** When you're satisfied that the content is complete, check it against this guide, [the brand voice guide](https://brandcentral.microsoft.com/microsoft-brand/brand-identity/voice.html) (which requires Microsoft network access), and your group's editorial style guide to make sure it's ready for customers and consistent with other Microsoft brand experiences.

   - Make sure the content is easy to use and shows a high level of craft.
   - Pay attention to details like sentence-style capitalization and correct punctuation. To learn more, see [Capitalization](/style-guide/capitalization) and [Punctuation](/style-guide/punctuation).
