# Microsoft Style Guide Test Document

Welcome to our documentation! This document demonstrates Microsoft Style Guide principles and can be used to test the MCP server functionality.

## Getting Started

You can quickly set up your environment by following these steps:

1. **Install the software** - Download and run the installer
2. **Configure settings** - Open the app and go to Settings
3. **Connect your account** - Sign in with your credentials
4. **Start using the features** - You're ready to go!

## Writing Tips for Great Content

Here are some key principles from the Microsoft Style Guide:

### Voice and Tone
- **Be warm and relaxed** - Use contractions and natural language
- **Stay crisp and clear** - Write for scanning first, reading second
- **Be ready to help** - Use action-oriented, supportive language

### Grammar and Style
- Use active voice when possible
- Keep sentences short and clear (under 25 words)
- Address readers directly as "you"
- Use imperative mood for instructions

### Terminology
- **API** (not Api or api)
- **email** (not e-mail)
- **online** (one word)
- **sign in** (verb), **sign-in** (adjective/noun)
- **set up** (verb), **setup** (noun)
- **website** (one word)

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example
"You can easily create a new project by clicking the New button. If you need help, we're here to support you."

### ❌ Needs Improvement
"The creation of new projects can be facilitated through the utilization of the New button functionality. Users should perhaps consider seeking assistance if required."

### Why the good example works:
- Uses "you" to address the reader directly
- Simple, clear language
- Active voice ("you can create" vs "can be facilitated")
- Helpful, supportive tone
- Action-oriented ("clicking the New button")

## Accessibility and Inclusive Language

### ✅ Use This
- "Everyone" instead of "guys"
- "Allow list" instead of "whitelist"  
- "Block list" instead of "blacklist"
- "Primary/secondary" instead of "master/slave"
- "People with disabilities" (person-first language)

### ❌ Avoid This
- Non-inclusive terms like "guys," "lame," "crazy"
- Terms with unconscious bias
- Gendered pronouns in generic references
- Ableist language

## File Types and Extensions

When writing about files:
- **.md** files for Markdown
- **.txt** files for plain text
- **.json** files for configuration
- **.py** files for Python scripts
